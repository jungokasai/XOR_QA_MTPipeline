Demonstrations against such measures had resulted in a number of casualties , including deaths , arbitrary arrests and torture of detainees .
Speakers called upon the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to appoint a commission to investigate those human rights violations ; abolish martial laws and the emergency situation ; release political prisoners ; restore confiscated land ; and implement measures to ensure the full enjoyment of civil and political rights without discrimination .
The history and current problems faced by the Assyrian minority of Iraq were raised .
Recommendations for action included the creation of an Assyrian Administrative Region to safeguard the cultural , linguistic and religious rights of Assyrians , and an independent commission to handle claims and disputes concerning minorities in the Kurdish - controlled areas of northern Iraq .
Concerning the situation of minorities in Greece , the Government was encouraged to recognize the existence of the Turkish minority ; create a positive environment for the minority 's members to exercise their freedom of worship and choose their own religious leaders ; and to ratify the Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities .
The Working Group was informed about the situation of the Turkmen minority in Iraq , including in areas controlled by Kurds .
Reported abuses by the Kurds included unlawful expropriation of land and property , extralegal executions , violations of civil and political rights and repression of the media .
Speakers urged that the perpetrators of such offences be prosecuted and the Kurdish militia disarmed and disbanded .
They called on the Government of Iraq to recognize Turkmen as the third ethnic group in the country ; recognize their rights in the new constitution ; ensure fair representation , including through self - government in their own territory if a federal system is adopted ; and designate Turkmen as an official language .
In a follow - up statement to a situation raised last year at the Working Group , the current situation of the Sama Dilaut nomadic fisherfolk was described .
Fear of piracy had forced them into the unfair partida system , a form of bonded labour . Others became beggars .
A number of recommendations were made to improve their situation , including : implementation of the recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ( CERD ) and existing fishery laws , investigation of cases of piracy , and adoption of legislation recognizing traditional migration areas as sanctuaries .
Reference was also made to the situation of the Bangsamoro in the Philippines and of the importance they attached to protecting their ancestral domains .
Quoting from advocacy material of the Bangsamoro people , it was stated that “ Only a war against poverty , injustice and discrimination can heal the festering wounds of conflicts and scorch the ground that breeds terrorism . ”
The Working Group was informed about the current situation facing the Batwa in Burundi .
Speakers expressed their concern over their marginalization by both the Hutus and the Tutsi and that conflict resolution and power - sharing arrangements did not yet include the Batwa .
The fact that 98 per cent of the Batwa community did not possess an identity card undermined their right to vote or move freely within the country .
Appeals were made to the Government of Burundi to undertake legislative and other measures to ensure their inclusion , recognize their rights , including through the provision of identity cards , eradicate extreme poverty and debt servitude and provide free education for Batwa children .
Clustering of issues
( a ) Roma
The problems faced by the Roma in The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Kosovo and Bulgaria , as well as outside Europe , were brought to the attention of the Working Group .
With respect to The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia calls were made for the system of administration of justice to be applied without discrimination against the Roma and for United Nations bodies to monitor this situation .
Other speakers addressed problems facing the Roma from Kosovo , particularly in the context of the future status of Kosovo and the Kosovo Standards Implementation Plan .
Despite progress in the area around Pristina , problems remained in the rural areas .
Considering the continued unsafe situation , that return to Kosovo should be strictly voluntary , not mandatory , and assistance should be provided for the reintegration of returnees .
Issues of segregation and discrimination affecting Roma in the education system in Bulgaria were addressed by one speaker .
Recommendations made included the implementation of the Framework Programme for Equal Integration of Roma in Bulgarian society and a national programme for desegregation in schools , and the establishment of a public fund in support of Roma students .
( b ) Afro- descendants
Attention was drawn to problems faced by Afro-Colombians and Afro-descendants in the United States of America .
Afro-Colombians continued to be victims of racial discrimination and exclusion , as regards access to health , livelihood , social security , education and income - generating activities .
The Government of Colombia was called upon to ratify and implement the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination ( ICERD ) ; prohibit the use of discriminatory language in the media ; and eliminate discrimination in the labour market .
Attention was drawn to the common features of Afro-descendants as the descendants of slaves who had been deprived of their mother tongue , culture and religion .
Apart from recognition , compensation was sought for the loss of their identity and for continued human rights violations due to the lingering effects of slavery .
The Working Group was called upon to continue to support and assist Afro-descendants , including through the organization of regional seminars for Afro-descendants .
( c ) Nomads , pastoralists , hunter gatherers and shifting cultivators
Several speakers drew attention to the plight of pastoralists in Ethiopia .
Their problems included displacement from their land , poor socio - economic development and lack of access to decision - making .
Lack of access to water and pastures , coupled with the easy availability of small arms and light weapons , had led to increasingly violent conflicts between pastoral groups , further undermining development and affecting young people in particular .
Recommendations proposed included the establishment of a national institution with real pastoral representation ; the creation of a plan of action for sustainable pastoralism ; and strengthening traditional conflict management systems .
They called for support from the United Nations and for the Government to agree to a visit by the Special Rapporteur on the right to education .
( d ) Religious minorities
Several speakers reported on the situation of the Egyptian Christian Copt minority .
Although the Egyptian Constitution provides for freedom of religion and equal opportunity , in practice religious minorities face many problems .
Equality before the law had not been assured or implemented with respect to administrative provisions governing religious conversion , restrictions on building places of worship , and tax exemption for the construction of such buildings .
Cases of forced conversion of underage Christian girls to Islam were also reported .
Other examples given of unequal treatment before the law related to marriage laws and laws regulating custody of children .
Employment opportunities in Government positions and State security were not equally distributed among all parts of the population .
Another concern referred to discrepancies between official statistics and estimated numbers of Copts .
A major cause of the problems was perceived to be the absence of a specific provision in the Egyptian Constitution recognizing the Copts as a minority and providing for their protection .
Speakers recommended , inter alia , that the Government should consider extending the freedom to convert from and to all religions and that the police should not be involved in the conversion process ; that references to religion should be removed from identity cards and official papers ; that educational curricula should promote religious tolerance and discriminatory references removed ; that the Copts be recognized as a national minority ; and that the Egyptian National Council for Human Rights consider minority rights .
The situation of the Christian minority in Senegal was referred to and it was recommended that the Government should consider adopting a prevention strategy to curb religious intolerance , focusing on education and dialogue , and that the African Union should establish specific mechanisms for the protection of the rights of minorities .
Information was presented on the situation of the Muslim minority , mainly of Moroccan origin , in the Netherlands and concern was expressed about instances of increasing Islamophobia .
The Government was urged to implement effectively the provisions of ICERD , especially article 2.2 , and to monitor speeches in the media or by public figures to ensure that they did not promote hatred .
Human rights issues and violations affecting religious and ethnic minorities in Bangladesh and the prevailing situation of impunity were reported .
The Government was urged , inter alia , to restore recognition of Bangladesh as a secular country in the Constitution ; to take all measures to combat discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities ; to ensure the fair representation of minorities in the military , foreign service , paramilitary , police and civil services ; to prosecute those responsible for human rights violations committed against members of religious and ethnic minorities ; and to implement the peace agreement relating to the Chittagong Hill Tracts .
( e ) Linguistic minorities
Problems facing the Wayeyi , as well as other linguistic minorities in Botswana continued to be reported .
The speaker appealed to the international community to continue to take an interest in their situation as Bill 34 of 2004 had been passed in April 2005 , despite a High Court judgement pointing out that the law had discriminatory effects because it did not address the issue of minority representation .
Speakers recommended that the Government of Botswana dialogue with the minorities to resolve the problem and ensure that minority languages could be used in public media and education ; and that the United Nations encourage Botswana to ratify the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and to make the declaration under article 14 of ICERD .
The attention of the Working Group was drawn to the range of issues facing Nepal 's 61 indigenous communities with respect to preserving and promoting their languages , script and cultures .
It was reported that a disproportionate number of victims in the conflict between the Government and the Maoist insurgency were from their communities and that they were also affected by caste - based discrimination and denied equal access to resources .
It was recommended that the Government ratify International Labour Organization Convention No. 169 and provide greater recognition of indigenous languages , teaching them in schools and removing the language barrier for Government posts .
They further appealed for full and effective representation in decision - making and for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to minorities affected by the conflict .
The decline of the population identifying itself as Amazigh and use of the Tamazigh language in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya were brought to the attention of the Working Group .
It was said that Law No. 24 - 1984 prohibited the use of Amazigh names for places and children , in violation of the Declaration and the Convention on the Rights of the Child .
The speaker also reported on the arbitrary detention of academics advocating the teaching of Tamazigh language and history .
He referred to recent developments in Algeria and Morocco , where Tamazigh speakers had the right to use their language , and called for the repeal of Law 24 .
Serious allegations were made in regard to the Ahwazi ethnic minority in the Islamic Republic of Iran .
It was reported that they were denied the use of their language and participation in decision - making .
They did not benefit from oil revenues from their ancestral land , and lacked basic services such as electricity , telephones , schools , hospitals and health clinics .
Other violations included forced displacement and appropriation of land .
The speaker reported on a demonstration on 15 April 2005 at which Iranian security forces allegedly opened fire on unarmed demonstrators , causing deaths and injuries , and asked that the upcoming visit of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions be expedited with a view to his conducting a visit to Khuzestan to investigate this incident .
It was also recommended that the Government allocate a portion of oil revenues to alleviate poverty , and that it fulfil the recommendation of CERD ( at it sixty - third session ) to “ provide an estimate of the demographic composition of the population , including the Arabs in the Al - Ahwaz region of Khuzestan , in its periodic report ” ( CERD / C /63 / CO / 6 , para .
( f ) Displaced minorities and other situations affecting minorities
The issue of the responsibility of non-State actors to respect minority rights was raised in regard to the activities of transnational corporations in the oil - producing Niger Delta of Nigeria .
Several speakers reported on the particular problems faced by minority groups living there , including : environmental degradation and contamination and the associated health problems ; inequitable distribution of profits and employment ; forced evictions and the demolition of their homes without prior notice or consultation and without provision of alternative housing or compensation ; violation of women 's and children 's rights ; and the loss of their language and culture .
Numerous recommendations were addressed to the Government and the international community , including : the provision of alternative accommodation for the evictees and payment of compensation ; amending the Land Use Act to provide for ownership by minorities and their participation in the management of land , or repealing it ; adequate representation of minorities in parliament ; financial compensation for the oil spillage in 1990 ; elaborating a national policy on the protection of minorities and appointment of a minister in charge of minority affairs ; promotion of the study and use of all languages in schools irrespective of the ethnic group ; and debt cancellation .
It was further recommended that transnational corporations should respect the provisions of the Global Compact .
The situation of the Khasi ethnic group residing within the northern State of Meghalaya in India was brought to the attention of the Working Group .
The ethnic group remained exposed to various forms of violence by State and non-State actors , resulting , inter alia , in displacement , killings and kidnappings by armed groups , torture and arbitrary detention in the context of the ongoing inter-state boundary dispute and the ongoing boundary demarcation between Bangladesh and India .
Displacements were also caused by major development projects , such as large dams or mines .
Additional concern was caused by the illegal entry of Bangladeshi immigrants into the area .
The Working Group was asked to urge the Government of India to recognize , protect and promote the rights of minorities and enact the requisite legislation ; to urge the development of a coherent response to internal displacement ; to ratify the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ; and to integrate minority rights into the country 's development programmes with a view to achieving the Millennium Development Goals .
Two issues were raised with respect to the Uzbek community in Kyrgyzstan .
The first issue was access to mother tongue education , and a recommendation was made to open at least one school with multilingual education in each city in provinces where the community was mixed .
The second issue centred on the treatment of refugees from Uzbekistan after the recent events in Andijon in May 2005 .
An appeal was made to the Government of Kyrgyzstan to grant refugee status to asylum - seekers who had entered neutral territory after 16 May ; to encourage local Uzbek community leaders to assist refugee camp residents ; and to invite an OHCHR mission to meet with the refugees and take their testimonies .
A representative of the Turkana group in Kenya highlighted a number of human rights issues , especially as they affected women , and that the increased availability of small arms and light weapons in neighbouring countries was causing violence and casualties .
She appealed to the United Nations to encourage the Government of Kenya to adopt the current draft constitution , which contained a recognition of minorities in the preamble and a bold definition of minorities and provided for minority communities ' protection and full participation in political , social and economic life , as well as a chapter on the promotion of culture .
The situation of the Terik minority was raised for the first time outside Kenya .
The minority was not constitutionally recognized as an ethnic group ; some members had identity cards with the names of other groups , which was deemed to constitute forced assimilation .
Additional violations of their rights included the loss of their language and forced displacement , which had left them with only 20 per cent of their ancestral land .
There was another appeal to the Government to adopt the draft constitution .
Other recommendations included officially recognizing the Terik ethnic group with a specific code number for identity cards , affirmative action and dialogue with the minority , and undertaking a study on the loss of their ancestral land .
Noting that the Terik language was endangered , the speaker referred to an ongoing project to write books in Terik and requested financial assistance from the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization in this regard .
A participant from Senegal indicated that there were an estimated 57,000 refugees in Senegal , many of whom had lived there for a long time .
He appealed for a dialogue between the Government and the refugee community , with a view to finding long - term solutions , including through according Senegalese citizenship , and assisting refugees who wished to return with support from the international community .
Statements were heard on the situation of Somali women and the Anywa people in Ethiopia .
As both women and members of a minority , the Somali Anywa women were particularly vulnerable to violations of their rights such as early and forced marriage , female genital mutilation and related health problems including AIDS , rape , sexual harassment and domestic violence .
They lacked access to social services and justice and that needed to be remedied . The representative of the Anywa people cited a number of allegations of violations of their human rights , including killings , rapes , looting and burning of houses .
He described in particular a massacre in Gambella from 13 to 16 December 2003 , and additional incidents during 2004 in Abobo and Gilo .
He appealed to the international community to conduct an independent investigation , to bring the perpetrators to justice , and to provide compensation and assistance for projects to help the victims .
Attention was drawn to the situation of the 250 million Dalits in India who continued to face entrenched discrimination causing conflict and violence .
Unlike Dalit Sikhs and Buddhists , Muslim and Christian Dalits had not been granted Scheduled Caste status under domestic legislation .
An appeal was made to the Government to recognize Christian and Muslim Dalits as Scheduled Castes and to encourage NGOs to provide human rights training and organize workshops to inform Dalits of their rights .
The observer for United Nations Watch raised the critical situation regarding minorities in Darfur , Sudan .
Numerous international agreements had been violated in the form of killings , attacks , abductions , harassment , looting of property , recruitment of children into armed forces , violence against children and rape , which was also a crime against humanity .
He called on the Working Group to condemn the indiscriminate attacks against civilians , the climate of impunity , the continuing violations of the N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreements of 8 April 2004 and the Abuja Protocols of 9 November 2004 by all parties , and the Government 's support of the Janjaweed militias .
The Working Group was also requested to call upon the Government of the Sudan to take a number of measures with a view to ending the violations , and to consider creating a truth and reconciliation commission once peace was established in Darfur .
A positive situation was presented in regard to the Jewish community of Azerbaijan .
Following a period of forced integration , the Government had changed its position and the minority 's rights to use their language and practise their religion were now being promoted and protected .
The issue of the interlinkage between minorities and statelessness was raised with respect to the situation of the Rohingya of Myanmar .
The 1982 Citizenship Law deprived the 1 million members of this Muslim minority of the right to a nationality , and their freedom of movement had also been severely restricted .
Many were also victims of forced labour and barred from Government employment .
There was an appeal to the Working Group to call on the Government of Myanmar to repeal the Citizenship Law and to incorporate minority rights into national legislation .
With respect to information presented on the situation of minorities in Pakistan , it was indicated that they often faced discrimination on account of their religion and in the economic and political spheres .
There was an appeal to the Working Group to encourage the Government to promote policies of inclusion .
Government responses
The observer for Burundi agreed that the Batwa had been marginalized from economic and political life and subjected to forms of servitude .
However , he stressed that those problems were also shared by the majority .
He highlighted the efforts being made by the Government in the areas of social , political and military reforms and expressed the hope for positive changes for the majority and the minority with the upcoming elections and new political institutions .
The observer for Egypt expressed concern about the use of selective quotations and misinterpretations of the Islamic religion employed by one of the speakers .
He underlined that Egyptians were one people and that the Copts were part of the fabric of the Egyptian society , and that the concept of minority was neither relevant in the Egyptian context , nor was it used by the Coptic leadership in the country .
The Egyptian Constitution provided for equality for all citizens , freedom of belief , and access to legal proceedings in case of discrimination .
Examples were given of Coptic people holding high public positions .
The observer rejected the allegations and accusations made and affirmed the inclusive nature of the State and Government policies .
He questioned the use of the Working Group as a venue to raise such allegations and made reference to the work of special procedures and the replies submitted by his Government to those mandates .
The observer for Finland presented information on recent developments to protect the rights of the Saami minority in Finland , such as the Language Act and the new Saami Act.
An advisory board for language affairs had also been established and received periodic reports on the situation of national and minority languages .
The representative also mentioned the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman in 2001 , and that an advisory board assisted the work of that office .
The observer for Greece affirmed Greece 's commitment to safeguarding minorities , including providing for minority education .
He explained that the existence of the minority was not denied , but rather that it was misleading to identify the Muslim minority as being only Turkish .
He explained that muftis were appointed rather than elected because they exercised judicial functions , and that that was not contested by the European Court of Human Rights .
The observer for the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed surprise that a document that had been withdrawn from the Commission on Human Rights was being distributed at the Working Group , and questioned the figures regarding landmines .
He asserted that Khuzestan was an integral part of the territory of Iran and that the people enjoyed equal rights , as guaranteed by the Constitution .
The observer for Kenya stressed that the Constitution specifically prohibited discrimination .
Kenya was truly a multiracial and multi-ethnic society , with over 42 languages , and boasted of an active commission on human rights , including commissioners from minority groups .
The issue of land rights for those in forest areas was one the Government took very seriously , and a comprehensive land reform exercise was under way .
Effective mechanisms existed for redressing grievances .
Incidents of insecurity often arose from inter-ethnic conflicts , exacerbated by illicit small arms and light weapons , a priority issue for the Government .
Concerning cultural practices such as female genital mutilation and forced early marriage , he encouraged NGOs and the United Nations to address those issues through education and awareness - raising .
Women 's rights to land and inheritance were on the agenda of the national commission on human rights , which was campaigning to eradicate the practice .
Although the constitutional review process had been terminated because of disagreements , the Government had promised to deliver a new constitution by December .
The draft constitution was a very forward - looking document .
He appealed to Kenyan NGOs to apply pressure on their representatives to adopt the constitution , as it was in parliament .
With reference to the Terik case , he cautioned against encouraging ethnic divisions and indicated that affirmative action was provided for , including in education and employment .
Most of the issues raised were general grievances that could be raised by almost any community in Kenya .
The observer for Kyrgyzstan stated that preserving peace and harmony between minorities was being pursued .
All of the 80 different ethnic groups in the country , including the 14 per cent of the population who were Uzbek , had the same rights and obligations under the Constitution ; 10 per cent of the deputies in parliament were Uzbeks , they were integrated into economic life , and radio and television broadcast in their language .
Addressing economic issues required the support of all , including minorities , the international community , private donors and the Government .
The refugee situation was being looked into by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Government had taken measures to provide aid to them .
He questioned the appropriateness of considering this question in the Working Group .
The observer for Nigeria acknowledged the existence of environmental problems in the oil - producing area of Nigeria and presented information on measures taken to address that issue .
Addressing more specifically the issue of evictions , the observer indicated that the shanty settlements had been illegally erected in areas reserved for urban development and announcements had been made that they would be subject to demolition in case of need .
He referred to the difficulties faced by the Government in tackling all the problems in its highly heterogeneous society and stated that although there were three major languages , there was no system of preference for any particular language or other discriminatory policy .
The observer for the Philippines noted the problems faced by the minority and the recommendations proposed and planned to convey them to the relevant Government departments .
She agreed that , due to the limited resources available , the Indigenous People 's Act was perhaps not as efficient as it could be and that there was a need to look more closely into the issue .
Information was also provided on the visit by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people , his recommendations and activities undertaken .
The observer for Pakistan provided information on measures taken to empower members of minorities and to improve their situation .
The observer for the Syrian Arab Republic spoke about the importance of constructive dialogue and gave information on , inter alia , the diversity within the country , the legislative provisions in place to ensure equality and protect against discrimination , measures taken to ensure respect for the rights of all citizens , assistance to refugees , and recent developments in relation to the granting of citizenship to refugees .
Several Government observers commented on the need to improve the organization of work under this agenda item and to avoid any repetition of issues under other agenda items .
EXAMINING POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS INVOLVING MINORITIES , INCLUDING THE PROMOTION OF MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN AND AMONG MINORITIES AND GOVERNMENTS
Under this agenda item , two main themes were discussed and two papers presented on those themes , namely “ Towards a general comment on self - determination and autonomy ” ( E / CN.4/Sub.2/AC.5/2005/ WP.5 ) , prepared by Marc Weller , Director , European Centre for Minority Issues , and “ The Millennium Development Goals : helping or harming minorities ? ” ( E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.5/2005/WP.4 ) prepared by Corinne Lennox , Minority Rights Group International .
Minorities and self - determination and autonomy
Mr. Weller indicated that his paper had attempted to answer a number of issues of concern in relation to self - determination and autonomy .
He presented those issues in the form of three questions .
Firstly , would linking self - determination and autonomy not lead to and legitimize disintegrative tendencies within States , including increased risks of secession ? Secondly , does the debate about autonomy represent a departure from the view that minority rights are individual rights rather than collective entitlements ? Thirdly , would a recognition of an entitlement to autonomy lead to unacceptable demands on the part of minorities ?
In answer to these questions , he said that international practice in respect of external self - determination , in the sense of an entitlement to unilateral secession , remained contextually restricted to instances of colonialism and closely analogous situations .
Self - determination , autonomy and human rights were linked in requiring States to make particular arrangements for the management of diversity .
Acceptance of autonomy as a tool for managing diversity did not necessarily imply recognition of a collective legal identity of minority groups .
He argued that it was the requirement to ensure full and effective participation that underpinned any claim to autonomy for minorities , and that it was for the State , albeit acting in genuine consultation with minority communities , to determine how it would give effect to the obligation to ensure the full and effective participation of minorities or members of minorities in public life .
While autonomy was increasingly being offered as a means to achieve that end , it was emphasized that there was not as yet a firm legal entitlement to autonomy in all instances of territorially compact minorities , although an indigenous identity might imply a collective legal personality and be expressed in an entitlement to territorial autonomy .
Elisabeth Naucler , Head of Administration of the Government of the Aland Islands , Finland , spoke about the importance of encouraging minority groups and States to find solutions to conflicts and of the importance of sharing good practices .
The autonomy accorded to the Aland Islands could be considered as a conflict - solving mechanism for a territorially compact minority .
She argued in favour of broadening the idea of self - determination , but reaffirmed that no link existed between autonomy and self - determination in the sense of an entitlement to secession .
She indicated that sub - State arrangements such as federalism or autonomy could have a twofold advantage in giving assurances of the territorial integrity of existing States and providing for the decentralization of power .
In her view , there was a need to make provision for the legal entitlement of autonomy due to its expanding use as a tool to accommodate minority issues .
She expressed the hope that the Working Group would continue its consideration of the question of autonomy and self - determination , particularly through its cooperation with the European Centre for Minority Issues and the preparation of a general comment on these issues as they affect minorities .
Members of the Working Group expressed gratitude for the papers presented .
They considered the moment opportune to examine the concepts of self - determination and autonomy and to consider in more detail possible models for the peaceful solution of minority issues , based on good governance and the rule of law .
In certain circumstances territorial autonomy could be an appropriate response , although there was no obligation on States to make such provision under the Declaration , a view shared by the observer for Azerbaijan .
In other situations , they agreed that greater self - governance over cultural , religious or linguistic matters might be a more suitable course of action .
Mr. Hadden cautioned against the Working Group narrowing its focus on autonomy and appealed for a parallel study of integrative measures , such as ensuring the full and effective participation of persons belonging to minorities in the civil service , police force and security forces .
Minorities and the Millennium Development Goals
Ms. Lennox stated that a major issue addressed in her paper related to the concern that the pressure on Governments to reach the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 could force them to compromise on the quality and sustainability of development interventions , with consequent effects on minorities .
In the paper , it was proposed that the principles of participation and non-discrimination be taken fully into account in developing strategies to achieve the Goals and that serious consideration should also be given to the issue of land rights .
With a view to applying the two principles , it was advocated that : Governments and international organizations should audit the participation opportunities for minorities , particularly in local Government structures ; and that impact assessments should be undertaken to ensure that strategies and policies to achieve the Goals did not unintentionally cause disproportionate or unjustifiable harm in the form of human rights violations against minority groups .
Particular action was called for in resolving land disputes involving minorities or indigenous peoples .
Land security with its links to income generation and food security was recognized as a fundamental issue for many poor people , and was considered a much more critical issue given its importance to the protection of the cultural rights of minorities and indigenous peoples .
Recommendations were also made for : the inclusion of information on minority situations and minority - specific time - bound targets in the reporting process on the Goals by Governments and donor countries ; the incorporation of minority concerns in national civil society campaigns on the Goals ; international actors such as the United Nations Development Group to support assessments of minorities ' progress towards achieving the Goals ; and the raising of issues relating to the Goals in the human rights treaty bodies ' reporting process , especially under ICERD .
In the course of the discussion , members of the Working Group and minority representatives expressed their appreciation for the paper .
Several additional proposals were made regarding the implementation of the right to education for minorities , especially in the Philippines .
The representative of the Meghalaya Peoples Human Rights Council also recommended : training on minority rights for staff of United Nations agencies and organizations and international financial institutions ; support from intergovernmental organizations for building the capacity of minorities to contribute to the planning , design , implementation and monitoring of poverty reduction policies and programmes ; the mainstreaming of minority rights and issues in the work of different United Nations organizations and bodies , particularly that of the United Nations country team ; the adoption of a rights - based approach in the elaboration and evaluation of poverty reduction strategy papers ( PRSPs ) ; and the full participation of minorities in the drafting and implementation of the PRSPs .
RECOMMENDING FURTHER MEASURES , AS APPROPRIATE , FOR THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS BELONGING TO NATIONAL or ETHNIC , RELIGIOUS AND LINGUISTIC MINORITIES
Under this agenda item , attention focused on the importance of better understanding regional and subregional perspectives on minority issues , including through the organization of subregional meetings and other initiatives .
Mr. Sorabjee , member of the Working Group , presented the outcome of the South Asian meeting on “ Minority rights : cultural diversity and development ” held in Kandy , Sri Lanka , from 21 to 24 November 2004 ( see E/CN.4 /Sub.2/AC.5/2005/4 and E/ CN.4/Sub.2/AC.5/2005/WP.6 ) .
He spoke about the importance of the South Asian subregional meetings in drawing attention to specific minority issues and to conflict situations .
Both the international community and persons living in the subregion were often unaware of existing conflicts as Governments had been adept at using international diplomacy to deflect attention from those situations . He referred to several recommendations adopted at the meeting which had been addressed to Governments .
They included proposals to : provide adequate and accessible remedies to address violations of the rights of persons belonging to minorities through independent courts and tribunals that were accessible to victims ; provide a standing invitation to special procedures and other United Nations bodies and mechanisms to monitor the situation of minority rights and vulnerable groups ; address the situation of non-citizens ; establish independent national human rights institutions and support their role in investigating and granting remedies for the violation of minority rights ; and consider establishing a regional human rights mechanism .
With reference to other recommendations addressed to the United Nations and international and intergovernmental bodies , particular mention had been made of the need to : encourage Governments to promote religious tolerance through public education and media programmes and to provide assistance to Governments for reviewing legislation and other measures with a view to ensuring that such measures did not discriminate against persons on the grounds of their religion ; and mainstream the protection of the rights of persons belonging to minorities in the work of international financial institutions and development projects .
During the discussion on the results of the seminar , it was pointed out that further measures needed to be taken to strengthen systems of accountability for violations of the human rights of minorities and to tackling issues relating to the denial of citizenship affecting persons belonging to minorities .
Greater consideration should also be given to establishing regional human rights mechanisms in Asia and to providing additional development funding to educational programmes for persons belonging to minorities .
Details were provided of the discussion and outcome of the Central Asian seminar on “ Minority rights : cultural diversity and development ” held in Bishkek , Kyrgyzstan , from 27 to 30 October 2004 .
These were presented by Saniya Sagnaeva , representative of the Central Asia project of the International Crisis Group and participant at the seminar .
Minority situations in six different countries had been considered during the meeting , including in the Feghana Valley region which encompassed areas of Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan .
Fuller details of the conclusions , recommendations and discussion are contained in documents E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.5/2005/5 and E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.5/2005/WP.2.
The conclusions and recommendations adopted at the Bishkek meeting covered three different themes : legislation and its implementation and national institutions dealing with minorities ; development of the languages , cultures and education of minorities ; and peaceful and constructive prevention and settlement of conflicts between ethnic minorities .
In the conclusions , it was stated , inter alia , that the Central Asian States had inherited an approach to minorities that promoted assimilation and the continued denial of problems relating to ethnic minorities .
National human rights institutions to protect the rights of persons belonging to ethnic minorities had not been established or were not developed and the problems of deported peoples and reparations had not been properly resolved .
As border problems remained and were a source of conflict in the subregion , participants called for the inclusion of civil society in the settlement of border conflicts .
The allocation of resources was also viewed as a possible source of conflict within and between countries , with participants calling on Governments and international organizations to solve problems relating to shared water resources , land leasing and gas distribution .
The absence of legislation dealing with statelessness and the persecution of persons on political or religious grounds were also identified as sources of tension in the subregion .
Recommendations were made for facilitating access across borders , speeding up the process of demarcation of borders and providing compensation to the inhabitants of border areas following their resettlement .
Additionally , it was recommended that international organizations should coordinate their work in the Ferghana Valley on the prevention of inter-ethnic conflicts and make greater use of the United Nations minority mechanisms in solving problems relating to minorities and stateless persons .
The observer for Romania made reference to a new initiative called the “ Roma Diplomacy Project ” organized by the European Roma Information Office and DiploFoundation .
The project was to run from June 2005 to April 2006 and aimed , inter alia , at creating a group of Roma “ public diplomats ” able to bridge the gap between Roma civil society and Governments and European Union institutions ; creating or strengthening Roma rights information networks ; facilitating the sharing of research and experience on Roma issues ; and building awareness of Roma issues .
This was to be achieved through an educational programme , support to research projects , provision of conference scholarships and internships , as well as developing an electronic platform for sharing knowledge between Roma rights activists .
Further information on this project can be obtained from http://www.diplomacy.edu/Roma.
A brief presentation was made on the purposes of the minority profile and matrix being developed by the participants in the first OHCHR Minority Fellowship Programme , organized in 2005 .
The matrix and profile had also been presented at the recent workshop on minorities and conflict prevention and resolution ( Geneva , 26 - 27 May 2005 ) .
Fuller details of the purposes and aims of the matrix and profile would be contained within the report of that meeting , which would be available at http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/minorities/seminar.htm.
Reem Mazzawi , one of five OHCHR Minority Fellows and co - Chair of the workshop , provided information about the workshop .
She explained that it had been attended by about 40 members of minority communities and organizations , observers for more than 40 States , members of the Working Group on Minorities , representatives of international intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations as well as academics and experts .
At the meeting minority representatives had presented their views on the root causes of conflicts affecting or involving minorities .
The workshop also considered ways in which minorities could better utilize United Nations human rights mechanisms and how they could participate more actively in the activities of other international , regional and national - level bodies to prevent and resolve conflict .
At the end of the two - day meeting , minority participants had drawn up a series of concluding observations on the root causes of conflicts and ways of solving them .
In this context , reference was made to the importance of continued work on the minority profile and matrix .
The concluding observations would be presented by some of the minority representatives at the workshop at the forthcoming global civil society conference to be held at United Nations Headquarters from 19 to 21 July 2005 .
This would provide an additional opportunity for the minority perspective to be heard at the international level .
She requested the Working Group to consider incorporating the issue of minorities and conflict prevention and resolution in the agenda of its next session , in order to consider the report of the global civil society conference and the further participation of minorities in the prevention and peaceful resolution of conflicts affecting or involving minorities .
The observer for the Civil Liberties Organization of Nigeria noted with interest the report of the African Commission on Human and Peoples ' Rights Working Group of Experts on Indigenous Populations / Communities .
She spoke about the need to create better awareness of minority rights as a framework for action within the region and proposed that such a meeting be organized , in cooperation with various non-governmental organizations , immediately prior to a session of the African Commission .
She also recommended the organization by OHCHR of a subregional meeting in West Africa , in cooperation with the Economic Community of West African States ; an NGO meeting prior to the African Union Assembly of Heads of State and Government ; and further meetings at the international , regional and national levels with a specific focus on conflict resolution and peace - building .
Representatives of several NGOs in a joint statement called for the Working Group to organize a regional meeting on minority issues in the Middle East .
Discussions under this agenda item focused on resolution 2005 / 79 of the Commission on Human Rights , in which the Commission requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to appoint an independent expert on minority issues for two years , and decided to reduce the meeting time of the Working Group on Minorities .
Statements were made by observers for five Governments , an academic institution and five NGOs , two of which made joint statements in the name of minority NGOs present at the session .
Members of the Secretariat dealing with administrative matters and the servicing of the Commission and the Sub-Commission informed the Working Group about possible practical arrangements for implementing resolution 2005 / 79 .
The observer for Austria provided extensive details of the negotiations that had led to the adoption by consensus of resolution 2005/79 with broad - based cross-regional support .
The momentum created by draft decision 6 of the Sub- Commission was used for the establishment of a new mandate of an independent expert on minority issues .
The observer for Switzerland referred to the restrictions on the Sub- Commission 's country - focused work and said that that had complicated the work of the Working Group when it came to making specific recommendations on promoting , protecting and implementing the rights of minorities .
A new mandate was needed to remedy this situation and to promote the implementation of the Declaration .
The observer for Pakistan spoke about the importance of ensuring that there was no overlap or duplication in the work of the independent expert and that of the Working Group .
The observer for Egypt noted that the mandate of an independent expert had been established because it was felt that more expert work was needed in the area of minority issues and to raise the profile of minority issues .
He observed that a main cause of the Working Group 's ineffectiveness had been the failure to observe or apply minimal standards or criteria as to the determination of the status of a minority , unlike the Human Rights Committee .
All but one of the statements made by NGOs focused on allegations of denial of minority rights and contained repetitions of ill - founded , unsubstantiated and misguided comments .
His Government would have preferred to hear more about best practices and successful experiences of assimilation .
Mr. Sorabjee reminded the plenary that the entire raison d'être of the Working Group was to give a voice to the voiceless , and Governments had the right to reply to the information presented .
A minority participant pointed to the fact that having minimum standards or criteria for the admission of minorities and particular rules of evidence was not suitable for the Working Group on Minorities , as it was not a judicial or a quasi-judicial body as were the treaty bodies .
Mr. Möller agreed with the observer for Egypt that mechanisms for the protection of human rights set up under ICCPR and its Optional Protocol provided better ways of assessing allegations ; however , as not all States had yet become party to the Optional Protocol , often minorities and persons belonging to minorities did not have the possibility to avail themselves of these mechanisms .
Two joint statements were made on behalf of minority representatives .
Many of the concerns expressed by previous speakers were raised , especially the reduction of meeting time .
They supported the proposal that consideration should be given to holding the meetings of the Working Group immediately prior to the Sub - Commission .
They reiterated the importance of the Working Group ensuring continued access for minority participants from NGOs without consultative status to present their situations and concerns , and proposed that the new independent expert should be able to take up some of these situations in accordance with his / her mandate .
They also emphasized the importance of mainstreaming minority issues throughout the work of the United Nations , including its work on conflict prevention , development and human rights .
Additionally , an expert from Queen 's University Belfast provided views on ways of making progress on minority issues .
Many participants agreed with those statements .
The statements made under this agenda item are available on the OHCHR web site .
In a closed meeting held on 3 June 2005 , the Working Group prepared a set of recommendations which were circulated , discussed and adopted in the public meeting during the afternoon session on that day .
Considerable discussion surrounded the question of meetings in subregions or regions , as well as the importance of ensuring respect for human rights principles and provisions in the application of security and anti-terrorism legislation .
Minor changes were made to take account of some of the comments made during the discussion .

Consideration of reports submitted by States parties under article 18 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women
Combined fifth and sixth periodic reports of States parties
Viet Nam *
* The present report is being issued without formal editing .
Preamble
In implementing Article 18 of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women ( CEDAW Convention ) and under the guidance of the CEDAW Committee , Viet Nam has submitted to the UN four periodic Reports which were adopted by the Committee .
With the permission of the CEDAW Committee , Viet Nam will submit the combined 5th and 6th periodic Report on the implementation of the CEDAW Convention in Viet Nam from 2000 to 2003 .
This period is characterized by the fact that Viet Nam continued to pursue economic reforms while having to cope with major challenges stemming from the adverse impacts of natural calamities , floods and droughts in all regions , social and environmental problems as well as economic integration and sharp competition in international markets .
The regional economy which has not regained strong growth momentum since the regional financial - economic crisis together with the implications of the September 11th event in the United States , and especially the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) and the Iraq war in 2003 exerted enormous impacts on Viet Nam 's development over the past three years and contained the country 's economic growth momentum .
Following the combined 3rd and 4th Report , this Report is to update the situation on the social , economic and human development in Viet Nam , the reform of the political and legislative systems and policies , the implementation of laws and policies as well as outstanding issues and solutions according to each concrete provision of the Convention during the past three years .
The Report also reviews the achievements recorded by the State and people of Viet Nam in realizing the Beijing Platform and the commitments of the Beijing + 5 Conference with serious consideration given to the recommendations by the CEDAW Committee to Viet Nam when the 2001 Report was submitted .
This Report has the following parts :
Part I : General Issues Part II : Implementation of the Convention Conclusion Annexes
To finalize this Report , a Drafting Committee was established with 22 representatives from related Ministries , Government agencies and socio-political organizations .
This Committee is headed by a Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs who also serves as Vice Chairman of the National Committee for the Advancement of Women .
In preparation for this Report , the Drafting Committee made many efforts in collecting and analyzing statistical data and hold various working sessions with Government agencies , socio-political organizations , and women representatives from all walks of life , scholars and social workers in order to benefit from their respective inputs .
With its point of views already presented in the previous Reports , the State of Viet Nam continues to make reservation on Paragraph 1 , Article 29 of the Convention .
However , consideration is being made to give up this reservation at an appropriate time .
The State of Viet Nam is also considering signing the Protocol of the Convention .
Part One General issues
Viet Nam 's overview
The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is located in South - East Asia , and has a natural area of more than 331,000 sq km
Viet Nam has 54 ethnic nationalities with the majority being the Kinh ( Vietnamese ) , representing 86.8 % of the population .
Vietnamese is the official language .
Hanoi is the Capital city of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam .
Vietnam 's population increased from 76.597 million in 1999 to 80.902 million in 2003 .
Of the total population , women account for 50.8 %.
In 2003 , population density stood at 245 people / sq . km , urban population accounted for 25.7 %.
In 2002 , 30 % of the population was under 15 years old and population over 65 years old increased to 6.3 % .
In 2003 , the population growth slowed down to 1.47 % ; the mortality rate of under one - year - old and under five - year - old children was 21 % and 42 % respectively , maternal mortality rate was 0.85 % .
The ratio of households headed by women increased to nearly 27 % in the year 2003 .
In 2002 , people of regular working age and working capacity were 44.73 million ( accounting for 56.1 % of the population ) of which women accounted for 50.6 % .
The labour force working in all sectors of the national economy rose from 36.7 million in 2000 to 38.7 million , 41.2 million and 50.9 million in 2002 , 2003 and 2004 respectively , among these women made up over 50 % .
In 2002 , the average life expectancy was 71 ; life expectancy of women was 73 .
In 2003 , GDP per capita was over $ 485 , inflation stood at 3 % ; urban unemployment was 5.78 % , of which the unemployment among women accounted for 7.22 % .
Over the past three years , Viet Nam has continued with the reform process ( Doi Moi ) initiated by the Communist Party in 1986 .
The Strategy for Socio-economic Development in the 2001 - 2010 period was announced with an overall objective to “ bring Viet Nam out of the underdeveloped status , considerably improve the people 's material , cultural and spiritual life , lay the foundation for Viet Nam to basically become a modernized and industrialized country by 2020 ; develop human resources , scientific and technological capacity , infrastructure , economic power , defense and security ; basically form institutions of the socialist - oriented market economy , uplift Viet Nam 's stature in the international arena ; double GDP compared to the year 2000 ; significantly improve the human development index ( HDI ) , eliminate hunger , quickly reduce poor households , raise the average life expectancy to 71 , universalize lower secondary education , lower the ratio of under - five malnutrition down to 20 % ; significantly improve the people 's material , cultural and spiritual life in a secured and healthy environment , conserve and improve the natural environment ” .
The Strategy has focused on building and developing human capacity , bringing into full play the effectiveness of human resource development in the cause of building Viet Nam “ a strong country with wealthy people , a just , democratic and advanced society ” .
The implementation of the Strategy also helps the Vietnamese Government effectively realize its commitments to the CEDAW Convention .
Despite many difficulties described in the Preamble , Viet Nam has worked out appropriate solutions for maintaining political stability and promoting socio - economic development .
The Government agencies at all levels have undertaken administrative reforms .
Laws and policies continued to be harmonized , helping accelerate the Doi Moi process .
Between 2000 and 2003 , the economy registered relatively high growth compared to the previous years with the growth rate of 6.8 % , 6.9 % , 7.08 % and 7.26 % in 2000 , 2001 , 2002 and 2003 respectively .
The economic structure was shifted along the line of industrialization and modernization .
Growth was seen in all sectors of the economy .
In 2003 , the share of GDP of each sector was 21.83 % for agriculture , forestry and fishery ( 24.5 % in 2000 ) , 39.5 % for industry and construction ( 36.7 % in 2000 ) , and 38.22 % for services ( 38.74 % in 2000 ) ; industrial output was VND 302,990 billion , a 16 % increase compared to 2002 , export turnover was VND 20,176 billion ; grain food output reached the highest level of 37 , 4 million tons in 2003 , one million ton ( 3 % ) increase against 2002 .
In parallel with economic achievements , the reform process in Viet Nam has also seen encouraging development in the social field .
Remarkably , the Human Development Index is higher than indicators on economic growth .
According to 2003 UNDP Human Development Report , of 175 countries , Viet Nam is ranked the 109th in terms of human development with HDI of 0.688 while in terms of income per capita , it is ranked the 128th .
Viet Nam 's Gender Development Index ( GDI ) is 0.687 ( ranking the 89th among 144 countries ) .
With that , Vietnam is named among the most successful countries in South East Asia and Asia Pacific .
In Viet Nam , there is nearly no disparity between HDI and GDI .
In addition , Viet Nam continuously takes the lead among developing countries in terms of poverty reduction and recorded encouraging results in the fields of job creation , education and training , population and family planning , and people 's healthcare .
Each year , the National Target Programme on poverty reduction and job creation helps 300,000 households escape poverty .
In 2003 , the ratio of poor households was brought down to only 11.8 %.
Over the past three years , 4.3 million jobs have been created , a half of which is for women .
In 2002 , literacy rate was 94 % among the population and 92 % for women .
In 2003 , 19 provinces and cities achieved lower secondary education universalization at national standard .
Between 2001 and 2003 , people 's health care , especially for mothers and children , was unceasingly improved .
Total birth rate and natural population growth rate continued to fall , reaching the levels of 2.13 and 1.47 % respectively in 2003 .
In 2002 , more than 90 % of communes and precincts had health stations and essential drug funds to meet the people 's need for medical examination and treatment .
Public investment in the social fields continued to increase by year , accounting for more than 25 % of the State budge expenditure .
Nevertheless , poverty and the income gap between regions remain an obstacle to the implementation of the CEDAW Convention .
Major challenges at present are : the ratio of poor households remains high mainly in the rural , upland and ethnic minority areas which are faced with economic and social difficulties .
Female farmers in remote and mountainous areas , especially single , household - headed and elderly women are the most vulnerable .
Poor women must work longer with less income , they hardly have the right to make decisions in their families and in the community , and therefore they have limited access to resources and the benefits of public policies .
In a nut shell , in face of numerous difficulties and challenges , during the last three years , the Vietnamese Government has continued with the reform and recorded remarkable achievements in economic growth and social development .
The people 's life has been gradually improved , security and socio-political stability firmly maintained .
Those are very important conditions for women to participate in and enjoy benefits , on an equal footing , from the country 's development .
General political structure
Over the past years , the political regime in Viet Nam continued to be stable ( see previous reports ) .
State agencies from central to local levels continued to be strengthened , thus ensuring better exercise of their functions and raising the quality and efficiency of their activities in accordance with the principles of the Constitution and law .
On 25 December 2001 , at its 10th session , the National Assembly of the 10th Legislature adopted Resolution 51/2001 / QH10 on the amendment of the 1992 Constitution .
With this Constitution amendment , the role of the National Assembly as the people 's supreme representative body , has been enhanced in the fields of Constitution making , law making and supreme oversight , thus the protection of fundamental human rights including women 's rights has been ensured .
The functions and responsibilities of the Government , Prime Minister and Supreme People 's Procuracy have been adjusted more properly with a view to making the executive apparatus more efficient , addressing corruption , and reducing red tapes .
Article 2 of the amended Constitution provides that the State of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is a law - governed and socialist State of the people , by the people and for the people ; every citizen , regardless of sex , ethnicity and social strata , is equal before the law ; women 's rights non-discriminated in any forms continue to be upheld and protected by the law .
Article 9 of the amended Constitution provides that the Viet Nam Fatherland Front is the political alliance and voluntary coalition of outstanding political , socio-political organizations including the Women 's Union , social organizations and individuals representing classes , all walks of life , ethnicities , religions and overseas Vietnamese .
Through their own organizations , women can demand protection of their lawful and legitimate interests once they are violated .
General legal framework for the protection of human rights
The legal framework and enforcement structure related to human rights protection as mentioned in the previous Reports continued to be consolidated .
During its 10th Legislature ( 1997 - 2002 ) , the National Assembly and its Standing Committee adopted 35 laws and 44 ordinances , one Resolution on the amendment of the 1992 Constitution , 6 Resolutions on the law and ordinance making programme .
Between 2001 and 2003 , 20 laws and 16 ordinances were adopted by the National Assembly and its Standing Committee , including laws and ordinances on women 's equal rights ( see Annex 2 ) .
In general , these legal documents have created the legal basis to better ensure human rights in general and women 's rights in particular .
Specially , the Criminal Procedure Code was adopted with provisions to ensure better human rights protection in criminal proceeding .
There have also been many developments in law implementation .
The Government has been working hard to concretize and provide guidance for legal documents adopted by the General Assembly and strengthen the implementation .
As a result , fundamental and important conditions have emerged for the realization of human rights as provided by the law , although not every practical requirements have been met .
The system of State agencies which exercise the function of law protection was further strengthened and developed .
The organizational structure , functions and tasks of People 's Courts , People 's Procuracies and other law enforcement bodies have been strengthened and defined more clearly with the aim of enhancing the judicial access of the people , ensuring prosecution in a transparent and law - observing manner , and raising efficiency of human rights protection .
Article 137 of the amended Constitution provides that the People 's Supreme Procuracy executes the rights of judicial prosecution and supervision , ensures strict and consistent law implementation .
During the new term of the Government ( 2002 - 2007 ) , there have been some changes in the jurisdiction and responsibilities of ministries and ministry - level agencies with clearer definition of the functions and tasks of these agencies to avoid overlapping and eliminate intermediary levels .
At present , there are 20 ministries , 6 ministry - level agencies and 14 Government agencies ( previously 17 ministries , 6 ministry - level agencies and 25 Government agencies ) .
The contingency of civil servants in law enforcement bodies have also been strengthened both in terms of quantity and quality .
To date , most of civil servants working in judicial and law enforcement bodies are university graduates .
The number of civil servants with post - graduate degrees in this field is increasing .
The qualification of judges , people 's accessories and prosecutors at all levels has been enhanced , increasingly responding to the task of protecting citizen 's rights and lawful interests including those of women .
Bar and layers associations , public notary offices , departments of judgment enforcement and supervision and legal aid offices for the poor for judicial assistance and citizen 's rights protection in all provinces and central - level cities have also been consolidated over the past three years .
Law Education and Information
Over the past three years , the introduction and dissemination of legal documents on human rights and women 's rights have been stepped up .
The Vietnamese Government has made great efforts in promoting dissemination and education aimed at increasing the people 's awareness of gender equality and women 's rights .
The Prime Minister has enacted Decision 13/2003 / QD - TTg approving the law dissemination and education Programme for the 2003 - 2007 period , which provides that women are beneficiaries of legal dissemination and education .
The programme also focuses on regulations directly related to women 's rights and responsibilities in the areas of marriage and family , the care , protection and education of children , gender equality in political , economic , cultural and social activities and in the family .
The Ministry of Justice , People 's Supreme Court have issued instructions on increasing activities for the advancement of women in which gender equality is fully mainstreamed in law information , dissemination and education .
In addition to the traditional forms of dissemination and education such as publication of leaflets , pocket books and posters , many seminars and workshops on gender equality and women 's rights have been held every year by different agencies .
The National Committee for the advancement of women has released in both Vietnamese and English 10,000 copies of the National Strategy for the advancement of Vietnamese women until 2010 , 7,000 copies of the Plan of Action for the advancement of Vietnamese women until 2005 , 5,000 leaflets about the CEDAW Convention , 10,000 leaflets about gender statistics in Viet Nam .
These leaflets and publications have been distributed nationwide .
Especially , to disseminate the combined 3rd and 4th Report on the implementation of the CEDAW Convention , the National Committee for the advancement of women held a conference to announce and release thousands of copies of the Report to participants .
The content of the CEDAW Convention and its implementation continued to be introduced through the mass media .
The recommendations of the CEDAW Committee to Viet Nam at its 25th Session have been translated into Vietnamese and forwarded to functional agencies for considering and working out solutions .
With regard to legal aid , the State of Viet Nam has paid attention to increase legal aid activities , especially for poor people , people subject to State priority policies and women .
In 2002 , the Ministry of Justice and the Women 's Union registered a cooperation programme on legal information and education and legal aid for women .
At present , two legal aid centres for women are in operation i.e. the Legal Aid Centre for women under the Department of Legal Aid , Ministry of Justice and the Legal Counseling Office on gender equality under the Women 's Union .
From 2000 to the end of 2002 , of the beneficiaries to the legal assistance provided by legal aid organizations , ethnic minorities and women accounted for 23 % and 42.9 % respectively .
Nevertheless , the operation of these agencies is still mainly focused on the urban areas and fails to meet all people 's needs .
Implementation of the Convention
Article 1 “ Discrimination against Women ” definition
In Viet Nam , the concept of " discrimination against women " mentioned in the previous Reports has not changed over the last years .
Moreover , the understanding of this issue at policy - making and law - making levels as well as in state agencies , social organizations , people 's communities , families and by each individual has been increasingly deepened .
Credits to that achievement should go to the State under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh , which is always aware that implementing equality between men and women is an extremely difficult and complex task , since " man preferences to woman behaviour has been seen for thousands of years and embedded in the mind of every individual , every family from all walks of life " .
Abolishing such chronic attitude is truly a " major and difficult revolution " .
We can not win this revolution by the use of force ; the weapon of this revolution is the political , economic , cultural and legislative progress of the whole nation .
In this process , each individual , each family and the entire people should be part of the revolution " .
As mentioned in the previous Reports , women 's rights continue to be respected and protected in accordance with the Constitution and law .
The political Report of the Communist Party 's 9th National Congress reaffirm " With regard to women , it is essential to enforce effectively legislations and policies on gender equality , nurture , provide vocational training , increase education for women ; develop policies to encourage women to participate more in the leadership and management at all levels and sectors ; provide health care and protection of mothers and children ; create conditions for women to exercise their function properly as mothers ; build wealthy , equal , progressive and happy families " .
This fundamental point of view is being institutionalized into concrete policies by the State .
Viet Nam has repeatedly expressed its right perception and strong determination the implementation of the international commitments for CEDAW member countries with a view to better ensure women 's equal rights .
Article 2 Measures to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination against Women
2.1 Continue to concretize the principle of equality between men and women
Measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women , including legislative , executive and judicial ones , as mentioned in the previous Reports , continue to be carried out effectively .
The principle of equality and non-discrimination between the sexes continue to be respected and stated in the legal documents enacted over the last four years such as : the 2001 revised Law on the Election of National Assembly Deputies , the 2002 revised Labour Code , the 2002 Law on the Organization of People 's Courts , the 2003 Law on the Election of the People 's Council Members , the 2003 revised Land Law , the 2002 Ordinance on Handling Administrative Cases , the 2003 Ordinance on Prevention and Combat of Prostitution , the 2003 Ordinance on Population , Decree 02/2001/ ND- CP for the implementation of the Labour Law and the Law on Vocational Training , Government Decree 01/2003/ND- CP on amendments and revisions of some articles of the Statute on Social Insurance , Government Decree 19/2003 / ND- CP on the responsibilities of State administrative agencies at all levels to ensure the participation in State management activities by the Women 's Union at all levels .
Remarkably , the revised Land Law and revised Statute on Social Insurance have basically addressed the issues relating to women 's access to land ( i.e. the names of both wife and husband appear in the Land Use Certificate ) as well as their equal rights with regard to social insurance ( i.e. at the age of 55 and having paid insurance for 25 years , retired female labour are entitled to receive the same pension as male labour at the age of 60 and having paid insurance for 30 years ) .
In their operation , State management agencies , judicial and law enforcement bodies have been taking measures to prevent and strictly handle violation of women 's equal rights and crimes against women .
In 2003 , the National Assembly decided to draft the Law on Gender Equality .
2.2 Concrete measures to protect women 's rights and lawful interests
For administrative measures , the Complaint and Denunciation Law provides that those who are responsible for handling complaints and denunciations , but refuse to do so or do so irresponsibly or intentionally do so illegally , will be strictly punished and as required by law , they will have to pay compensation for the damage caused by their action or inaction .
With this measure , women have equal opportunities to exercise their right to complain and denounce to competent individuals and state agencies when their rights and lawful interests are violated , especially that violation is of gender discrimination nature .
Nevertheless , over the past three years there were very few administrative cases filed by women at Administrative Courts for the reason of gender - based discrimination .
The law allows every citizen including women to exercise their right of requesting the Court to protect their rights and interests in civil , economic and labour fields .
Functional agencies such as Courts and judiciary bodies should also apply strict punishments to the acts of violation .
Law enforcement agencies have applied strict and right punishments to the crimes of discrimination , causing large damages to women 's health , dignity and honour ( see report on the implementation of Article 6 on the trial of traffic in women and exploitation of women for prostitution cases ) .
The revised Penal Code ( which entered into force on 1 July 2000 ) contains many provisions on protecting the life and health of the accused who are women .
The principle of pro-women procedure , a humane principle which is not regarded as discrimination against men , is being strictly implemented .
Decree 32/2002/ND-CP on the implementation of the Law on Marriage and Family among ethnic minorities has helped address the problem of discrimination against women in some remote and mountainous areas of Viet Nam given existing customs .
The Decree strictly prohibits polygamy , the customs of exacting wedding presents , wife robbery and string binding ( i.e. widows and widowers are forced to get married with other members of their deceased spouse 's family ) .
The Decree also provides measures to eventually eliminate backward and unfavourable customs for women in these areas .
2.3 Outstanding problems and solutions
The State and people of Viet Nam condemn gender - based discrimination and are making many efforts to eliminate the discrimination against women by diverse means .
However , there remain unfair behaviours toward women in the social life , especially in private companies , factories and joint ventures , etc .
In this regard , the State authorities concerned will take more resolute measures to ensure women 's equal rights to men and non-discrimination as provided by the law .
Labour unions , female workers ' unions and women 's unions at the grassroots level will be more proactive and active in assuming the role of supervising law implementation and protecting the legitimate and lawful interests of female workers .
The dissemination and education task will continue to be pushed forward so that every citizen , especially women , can fully understand and safeguard their own rights and lawful interests .
Article 3 Ensuring full development and advancement of women
Institutional framework
Since 2000 , legislation as well as other active measures taken by the State of Vietnam to ensure the development and advancement of women in all fields as mentioned in the 3rd and 4th combined report continued to be implemented .
Many resolutions and legal normative documents have been issued with particular emphasis on ensuring gender equality and women 's rights in civil , political , economic , cultural and social fields .
Notably are the following ones :
Resolution 23 - NQ / TW on 12 March 2003 of the Party 's Central Committee on promoting the strength of national unity to build a strong country with prosperous people and a just , democratic and advanced society , which states : “ continue to raise awareness in the public and the entire political system on women 's work and gender equality ; quickly institutionalize the Party 's policies on women and women cadres work in the new situation ; mainstreaming gender issues in the implementation of programmes and plans ; pay attention to social and gender policies to reduce work burden for women ; improve education levels and occupational skills for women ; enhance maternal and child health care ; enable women to participate in social activities and to hold managerial positions ” .
Decision 71/2001/QD - TTg on 04 May 2001 of the Prime Minister on national target programmes in 2001 - 2005 ( Hunger Eradication , Poverty Reduction and Employment , Clean Water and Rural Sanitation , Population and Family planning , Prevention and Treatment of Social Diseases and other fatal diseases including HIV / AIDS , Culture , Education and Training ) aimed to improve living standards of the people including women .
National Strategy for the Advancement of Women until 2020 ( approved by the Prime Minister with Decision 19/2002 / QD - TTg dated 21 January 2002 ) with the overall goal of “ improving the material and cultural life of women ; creating all conditions to implement basic rights and enhance the role of women in all political , economic , cultural and social areas ” .
The strategy also sets out five concrete objectives aimed to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women , promote gender equality at work , education , health care , increase the quality and efficiency of women 's participation in political , economic , cultural and social fields as well as in management positions , and improve the capacity in promoting women 's advancement .
Based on this Decision , on 18 March 2002 , the National Committee for Women 's Advancement of Vietnam adopted the Action Plan on Women 's Advancement of Vietnam till 2005 or the first stage of the 10 - year Strategy .
This plan is a component of the socio - economic development plan of the country in the first five years of the 21st century .
The comprehensive poverty reduction and growth strategy ( CPRGS ) ( approved by the Prime Minister in May 2002 ) , which has set out the goal of promoting rapid and sustained economic growth along with achieving social equity and progress in order to improve the living conditions and quality of all segments of the population and encourage human development and gender equality .
Decree 19/2003/ND-CP on 07 March 2003 of the Government on responsibility of Ministries , ministerial agencies and governmental bodies , people 's committees in cooperating with and enabling Women 's Unions at all levels to involve in state management work in accordance with legislation on issues relating to rights and interests of women and children .
These lines and policies have been widely introduced among ministries , agencies and associations and step - by - step translated into reality with concrete action plans .
All 40 central ministries and agencies and 64 provinces and cities have adopted and implemented the Action Plan for women 's advancement to 2005 in their localities .
Many local authorities and institutions under ministries , schools as well as big enterprises have also developed their own action plans for women 's advancement .
All these clearly show the great efforts of the State and people of Vietnam in promoting gender equality and women 's advancement .
Promoting organizations and activities for women 's advancement
For the last three years , the State has created every favourable condition for organizations working for the advancement of women to fulfill their roles .
The national apparatus for women 's advancement has been consolidated and developed down to grassroots levels ; responsibilities of ministries , agencies and associations have been clearly defined with involvement of many male leaders enhanced .
On 11 June 2001 , the Prime Minister issued Decision 92/2001 / QD - TTg in order to strengthen the National Committee for the Advancement of Women .
The decision sets out four tasks for the committee , namely : ( 1 ) assisting the Prime Minister in making laws and policies on women , cooperating with relevant agencies in supervising and promoting the implementation of legislation and policies on women ; ( 2 ) working with relevant agencies to carry out communication and educational activities regarding the implementation of legislation and policies on women and CEDAW ; ( 3 ) preparing national reports on the implementation of CEDAW ; ( 4 ) coordinating international cooperation activities on gender equality and women 's advancement .
Based on the decision , the Chairperson of the National Committee for the Advancement of Women has established the committee 's office to assist the committee in the discharge of its tasks .
The system of committees and boards for women 's advancement continues to be strengthened in ministries , ministerial agencies , governmental bodies and associations as well in all 64 provinces and cities across the country .
At present , this system is being developed in agencies at provincial , district and commune levels .
Resources for the operation of national as and grassroots committees for the advancement of women have been improved .
A national network on gender and development issues has been formed in some areas , notably are the national network on gender and energy development and the network of collaborators on gender mainstreaming established in 2003 .
The Vietnam Women 's Union has received continued attention and assistance from the State to carry out effectively campaigns and major work programmes for the advancement of women .
The 9th national congress and congresses at lower levels of the women 's union have finalized the structure of the union at all levels and added one more major work programme in the 2002 - 2007 term which is to promote friendship and cooperation with women in other countries for Equality , Development and Peace .
The congress has launched a large movement of “ actively studying , working and building happy families ” among women from all walks of life and stressed one its major work programmes which is to participate in making and supervising the implementation of legislation and policies on gender equality .
An outstanding activity of the Union for many years has been providing saving credit for poor women , an effective model widely recognized by domestic and international organizations .
The Union has also had many ways to honour individuals and groups of outstanding women as well as practical forms of education to enhance capacity for women .
The State has decided to use its budget to build a center for women and development under the Women 's Union of Vietnam and is study the project to establish the Institute for Women in order to response more effectively to women 's needs for comprehensive development and female personnel training .
The system of boards of women work under the Confederation of Labour Unions of Vietnam has also continued to be developed in administrative agencies and state owned enterprises to enhance the capacity in promoting gender equality and rights of female workers .
The coming into being of the Vietnam Women Entrepreneurs ' Council ( VWEC ) under the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry is an important event .
The council is formed to protect women entrepreneurs ' interests in domestic and international trade relations and to assist them in trade and investment promotion and technology transfer in Vietnam and abroad .
Women funds continue to be established in ministries and agencies to assist women in realizing their ideas and innovations , notably Ho Chi Minh City 's fund for women 's advancement and fund for women talent of the National Center for Social Sciences and Humanities .
In addition to the Kovalevskaya award , in 2002 the Prime Minister allowed the Vietnam Women 's Union to establish a Fund for Vietnamese Women Award to commend individuals and groups of women who have outstanding performances in development areas .
The award was conferred to the first five individuals and groups in 2003 .
3.3 Mainstreaming gender issues in policy making and implementation
The national strategy for women 's advancement to 2010 has identified gender mainstreaming in public policy as one of the main measures .
Since 2000 , gender mainstreaming has been studied and gradually applied in policy making processes .
For the first time , the “ Guidelines for mainstreaming gender in policy making and implementation ” have been compiled and published by the National Committee for the Advancement of Women .
Together with training manuals on gender mainstreaming , 150 people have been trained to become trainers to disseminate knowledge and skills on gender mainstreaming .
In two years , 2002 and 2003 , the National Committee for the Advancement of Women provided training on gender mainstreaming for 2855 officials and leaders of central and provincial agencies .
Gender responsibility has , thus , been increased among ministries and agencies .
Gender issues have been given greater attention in policy papers of the Government , ministries and agencies .
Especially in 2002 , the Prime Minister approved the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy .
Taking the lead in gender mainstreaming , in 2003 the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development designed and began to implement its “ strategy to mainstream gender in the field of agriculture and rural development ” .
For the last three years , the international community has funded many projects to promote gender equality and assist women in Vietnam such as the Vietnam - Belgium credit project , project on women - led business development funded by the Netherlands , and project on gender in public policy funded by the UNDP and the Netherlands .
It can be said that the spiritual , material and technical assistance of the international community has been practically instrumental in improving the quality of women 's life and narrowing the gender gap in Vietnam .
Study on women and gender equality
Gender research and training centers have focused their study on the roles of men and women in production ; the role and position of women in family ; changes in their roles under the impact of socio-economic development ; urbanization and labour movement from rural to urban areas ; domestic violence ; trafficking in women ; theoretical and practical basis of legal assistance for women .
Some of the research findings have been used for the making of legal documents on women and gender equality .
Some newly established or rearranged research institutes have conducted studies not just on women - related matters but also gender issues .
These include the Women Labour Research Center under the Ministry of Labour , War Invalids and Social Affairs , which has been renamed as Women Labour and Gender Research Center .
The School of Social Sciences and Humanities under the Hanoi National University has established a Gender and Development Research Center to conduct research on gender theories and practices with an aim of building a gender theory system that is suitable to Vietnam 's conditions and development strategy .
In early 2003 , the Vietnam Women 's Union also established its Research Council .
This Council receives annual funding from the state budget to do research on gender , women and the Union 's affairs .
Difficulties , constraints and solutions
Gender mainstreaming has been introduced recently , mostly at project level and without adequate regulations , experience and resources .
To implement the National Strategy for Women 's Advancement in the coming years , the Government will incorporate gender aspects in annual and five - year national socio - economic development plans .
Ministries and localities will also do the same with their respective plans .
In recent past , the preference of men to women remains in the mindset and even action of not a few people .
Some ministries , agencies and localities are yet to pay due attention to and create favourable conditions for women 's advancement .
Organizations and institutions working for women 's advancement have not worked effectively yet .
Many women still have inferiority complex and are inclined to be self - satisfied .
To overcome these shortcomings , the Prime Minister is considering the drafting of a new Directive on strengthening the work for women 's advancement in ministries , agencies , and regions , which clearly defines their responsibilities and activities for the advancement of women , mechanism and conditions for the integration of gender issues to policy - making activities .
The Vietnam Women 's Union is preparing a plan on the establishment of a Women Institute ( on the basis of the Women Cadre Training School ) in order to better train women officials .
It is expected that this plan will be completed in early 2005 and submitted to the Prime Minister for consideration .
At present , the Ministry of Planning and Investment is providing guidelines for the implementation of this strategic Direction .
Based on this strategic Direction , ministers and heads of ministerial agencies and governmental bodies , chairmen of people 's committees of provinces and central - level cities are actively developing and implementing their own agencies ' strategic direction for sustainable development .
Article 4 Special measures to promote gender equality
In implementing all legislation on gender equality , Vietnam continues to take special temporary measures as follows :
Additional special measures to promote gender equality
The Government has issued some documents such as : Decree 61/2001/ND-CP on 7 September 2001 on retirement age of coal mining workers ; Decree 98/2002/ ND - CP on 27 December 2002 on temporary detention and custody ; Decree 114/2002/ ND - CP on 31 December 2002 providing detailed guidelines to implement some articles of the Labour Code on salary ; Decree 12/2003/ ND - CP on 12 February 2003 on scientific fertility .
The Ministry of Labour , War Invalids and Social Affairs introduced , on 12 March 2003 , Circular 07/2003 / TTBLDTBXH providing guidelines on the implementation of some revised articles to the Social Insurance Regulations .
These documents provide as follows :
Female workers aged 55 , having paid social insurance for 25 years and male workers aged 60 , having paid social insurance for 30 years , are entitled to equal maximum monthly pension in accordance with the Government 's regulations .
The retirement age of both male and female coal mining workers is 50 if they have paid social insurance for 20 years and had at least 15 years working in this job .
Female workers who have paid social insurance for 15 years receive pension equal to 45 % of the average monthly salary , which is the basis for payment of social insurance , as applied for male workers .
And from the 16th year onward , for each year of paid social insurance they get additional 3 % of pension whereas the margin is 2 % for male workers so that the maximum average pension of both male and female workers is equal to 75 % of the average monthly salary .
The lump sum allowance for female workers having paid social insurance for more than 25 years from the 26th year onward will be as equal to that paid for male workers from their 31st year onward respectively .
And for each year of paid social insurance , they will receive one half of the average monthly salary up to five months .
Female workers on maternity leave , no matter how many births they have given , are entitled to natal allowance .
Single women are entitled to pregnancy supporting techniques at the instructions of specialized doctors .
Women aged 55 upward living alone without relatives and having no source of income continue to get social aid allowance if they are already entitled to .
Before executing death sentence given to women , conditions for non-application of death sentence as provided for in the Penal Code must be checked to see whether their sentence can be commuted to life imprisonment .
Women who are under temporary detention and violate regulations of the detention center and thus are subject to punishment of isolated detention in a separate room will not be fettered like men .
To help women improve their education , many central and local agencies have applied higher additional allowance rates during the education period for women than for men .
This policy has proved effective in encouraging women to overcome difficulties to improve their knowledge in all fields .
Measures to increase the percentage of women holding management positions at all levels and of female trainees participating training programmes as mentioned in the National Strategy for the Advancement of Women to 2010 and the National Action Plan for the Advancement of Women to 2005 have been used widely .
Especially , authorities and associations at all levels have paid attention to applying various forms of incentives and awards for women .
Some special measures to protect mothers
Legal documents on this matter include the Amendments to the 2000 Penal Proceeding Code , Decree 81/2000/ND-CP on 29 December 2000 providing guidelines to implement the Ordinance on public labour contributions , Decree 02/2001/ND-CP on 9 January 2001 guiding the implementation of the Labour Code and the Law on Vocational Training , Decree 19/2001 / ND - CP on 11 May 2001 on fines and administrative penalties for violations in radioactive safety and control , and Inter-agency Circular 73/2000/TTLT -BTCCBCP-BTC on 28 December 2000 of the Government 's Personnel Organization Bureau and Ministry of Finance providing guidelines for the implementation of the downsizing policy among administrative agencies and other budget users .
These documents have provided as follows :
Female defendants who are pregnant or raising children under 36 months of age and have clear residence address are subject other preventive measures instead of temporary detention , except for special cases .
Women who are pregnant , who are on leave due to miscarriage , having a baby stillborn or dead after birth and who are raising children under 36 months are exempted from annual public labour contributions .
Women who are pregnant or raising children under 12 months are not subject to the downsizing policy .
Women who are pregnant , who are on leave due to pregnancy related reasons and who are raising children under 12 months are not subject to labour disciplinary measures .
Female trainees , who are pregnant when carrying out the vocational training contract and certified by a medical center at district level or higher that the training would negatively affect the fetus , have the right to terminate the contract without paying compensation .
After the post natal leave , the trainee is allowed to continue with the training , if she so wishes and meets the requirements .
Enterprises and organizations must assign other jobs suitable to pregnant women or those in breast - feeding period if their current jobs are radiation - related .
Pregnant workers , who , as prescribed by a doctor , have to take leave , have the right to unilaterally terminate the contract .
During pregnancy , maternal leave and the first twelve months after delivery , female workers can temporarily delay the unilateral termination of their contracts and extend the time limit for consideration on disciplinary measures , except in case of the business being closed down .
During maternal leave , female workers that have paid social insurance shall receive allowances which are equivalent of 100 % of the salary , one extra monthly salary plus other social benefits as prescribed in the Labour Code .
Apart from the aforesaid documents , Vietnam has a large number of sectoral documents stipulating ways to better protect mothers , including the Safe Mothers Programme , tetanus vaccination and iron tablets for pregnant women programme , measures for the protection of heavily pregnant women during floods and other natural disasters .
Implementation and Future Directions
The Vietnamese relevant ministries and agencies have been active in implementing the above - mentioned regulations .
Some special regulations for women , though good in theory , have not yet been fully enjoyed by women in reality .
In 2002 , the VWU conducted a survey on the implementation of policies on women workers in rural areas .
The results revealed that although women caring for small children are , by law , exempted from community service , many have not exercised fully this right .
This is mainly because works of community service are by families , not individuals , and as a responsibility to their families , women caring for small children have to perform community service .
Besides , in some localities , after the harvests , men usually leave homes in search for work elsewhere , which means women have to perform the families ' community service .
Some regulations , including those on women 's age of retirement , jobs that are prohibited or limited for women , are in fact putting many women labourers in a disadvantaged position .
In a bid to address these problems , the VWU and other relevant agencies are working on proposals to the Government on measures to be taken in the near future .
On the issue of women 's retirement age , the Government has tasked the Ministry of Labour , Invalids and Social Affairs to study and make proposals to the Government for submission to the National Assembly .
The National Assembly has assigned the VWU , in collaboration with relevant agencies , with drafting the Law on Gender Equality for submission to the National Assembly .
Article 5 Role of Gender and Prejudices
Actions to eliminate gender discrimination and prejudice described in the previous report continue to be consolidated and expanded .
Guidelines and policies
The State of Vietnam resolves to eliminate all forms of discrimination between men and women in all aspects of life .
In recent years , the family has been playing an increasingly important role in nurturing and educating Vietnam 's future generations .
The State has put in place many essential documents to further strengthen the role of the family , including :
The 1992 Constitution , amended in 2001 , which provides that family is the cell of the society and does not accept any form of discrimination among children ( Article 64 ) .
Government Decree No. 70/2001/ND-CP dated 03 October 2001 provides detailed guidance for the implementation of the Law on Marriage and Family .
Accordingly , the State , Government agencies and social organizations undertake the responsibility to support families in economic development , building happy families , caring for the children , addressing domestic disputes and problems , preventing violence , especially against the elderly , women and children , to help equip family members with good behavioural skills , identify and encourage exemplary families and criticize families showing irresponsibility to their members and the society .
Government Decree No. 104/2003/ND-CP dated 16 September 2003 guiding the implementation of some articles of the Ordinance on Population strictly prohibits choosing the sex of the fetus ( Art . 10 )
The National Strategy for the Advancement of Women in Viet Nam till 2010 approved by the Prime Minister on 21 January 2002 provides that a principal measure is to promote information dissemination , education , and social mobilization to enhance the awareness and strengthen responsibilities of governmental agencies , organizations , families and each citizen on gender equality .
Government Decree No. 32/2000/ND-CP dated 27 March 2002 guides the implementation of the Law on Marriage and Family for ethnic minorities , providing for measures to eliminate obsolete customs and practices in marriage and the family .
Resolution No. 23 - NQ / TW dated 12 March 2003 by the Party 's Central Committee on “ Promoting the synergy of national unity for the goal of rich people , powerful country , just , democratic and civilized society ” reaffirms the implementation of the national movement to build enriched - cultural life and combat against social problems .
To expeditiously implement the above - mentioned policies , in May 2001 , the Prime Minister signed a decision to name the date of 28 June “ Viet Nam 's Family Day ” .
In 2002 , the National Assembly decided to establish the Committee for Population - Family and Children , which is merged by the Committee for the Protection and Care of Children and the National Committee on Population and Family Planning .
The emergence of the Committee - as a ministry - level agency to perform administrative management in the fields of population , families and children - has helped overcome the previous lack of state agencies in the field of family issues .
Information , education and communication activities to raise gender awareness
Over the past three years , relevant agencies have continued with efforts to educate the people to eliminate gender prejudice in the society .
A network of organizations for the advancement of women has been established .
These organizations have put in place training programmes on gender issues and mainstreamed gender in policy - making .
Mass organizations , particularly the Women 's Union , Fatherland Front and Labour Union , have shown strength in informing , educating and communicating with the people on gender equality , on building a cultured life , and building families of “ prosperity , equality , progressiveness and happiness ” .
The Ministry of Education and Training has taken steps to gradually remove gender prejudices that can still be seen in students books at various grades ( refer to the section on Art.10 implementation for further information ) .
The media , including Vietnam Television and Radio the Voice of Vietnam , has broadcasted many programmes on gender equality , highlighting prominent women in various sectors , thus helping change social perception of women 's role .
Gender issues have also been incorporated into health , agriculture and population training programmes . Contests on gender and family issues have been organized in many localities , which have helped raise the awareness and sense of responsibility of men in taking care of women and sharing the burden of domestic works .
Publications on various issues have provided the people with new understandings of gender issues ( refer to the section on Art.16 implementation for further information ) .
Difficulties and Solutions
Efforts have been made to eliminate gender prejudices and change the perception of the roles of women and men .
Yet , the impacts differ from field to field , from region to region .
This is largely due to the lack of comprehensive measures to remove the old paradigm of male chauvinism , which has been existence for thousands of years .
Vietnamese laws provide that in the family , the husband and the wife are equal in all aspects .
They should discuss and jointly decide on all common issues , and share the burden of caring for the children , the parents .
In reality , however , men are still considered as the pillar of the family , having the power to decide on major issues and representing the family in the community .
Meanwhile , domestic work , taking care of family members are considered as the “ given vocation ” of women .
The old system of labour division based on gender is , to certain extents , still maintained in some Vietnamese families , which has limited school opportunities for girls , and hindered women from taking up higher - level positions , getting high salary .
The maltreatment of women in some areas also takes its roots in male chauvinism .
Besides , obsolete customs and practices among some ethnic minorities , including child marriage , are impeding the advancement of women .
Aware of these problems , all relevant ministries and agencies will take steps to better enforce the country 's laws , regulations and policies on gender equality .
The Fatherland Front , Women 's Union and other political - social organizations at all levels will continue to promote the campaigns “ The people unite in building a new lifestyle in the community ” , and “ Building cultured families ” , which aims to achieve “ prosperity , equality , progress and happiness ” ; enhance education and communication activities to eliminate gender prejudices and practices harmful to women and girl children .
The Ministry of Home Affairs will study the incorporation of gender issues in training programs for public officials .
The mass media , particularly the radio and television , will increase the coverage of gender issues , thus helping to alter social perceptions of gender issues and raise the men 's sense of responsibility in domestic works and taking care of the children .
Article 6 Suppression of All Forms of trafficking in women and exploitation of women for prostitution
The trafficking in women and exploitation of prostitution of women remain pressing issues that attract the attention of the entire society .
The State of Vietnam reiterates its strong determination to eliminate these evils .
The prevention of trafficking in women and exploitation of prostitution of women is high on the agenda of all agencies and authorities .
All measures taken in this connection are aimed at protecting the health and dignity of women , helping build a just , progressive and advanced society .
Special attention has been given to the work of enacting and revising legal documents regulating and handling activities relating to trafficking in women and exploitation of prostitution of women .
Law - making
Recently introduced documents :
- Ordinance on Sanctions against Administrative Violations , No.44/2002/PL- UBTVQH10 , dated 02 July 2002 , issued by the National Assembly 's Standing Committee , entered into force on 01 October 2002 .

Viet Nam has also ratified the ILO 's Convention No. 182 concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour .
The ratification of the above - mentioned documents can be considered as the reaffirmation of the Vietnamese Government 's commitment before the international community to combat prostitution and pornography .
Implementing mechanism:
As the State management agency on combating social problems , the Ministry of Labour , Invalids and Social Affairs worked with the Ministry of Public Security , Ministry of Culture and Information , Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Health to issue related guiding documents ; collaborated with mass organizations like the Fatherland Front , Women 's Union , Youth Union , Confederation of Labour and Veterans ' Union , to launch campaigns with the participation of their members and the society as a whole to combat social vices , including prostitution and the trafficking in women and children .
The Ministry of Justice is assigned to work with relevant agencies to conduct surveys on problems of marriages between Vietnamese women and foreigners .
The Ministry of Public Security coordinated with relevant agencies to combat trafficking in women and children .
Implementation
Over the past three years , the fight against prostitution and trafficking in women has been vigorously upheld .
In September 2003 , the Government organized the National Conference on the fight against trafficking in women and children .
The Conference has put forth a number of effective measures to prevent the problem and support the victims .
A three - year review of the 2001 - 2005 Action Plan for the Prevention and Suppression of Prostitution has also been made .
The results of the review are as follows :
- Communication and education was identified as one of the most important measures , which has helped raise the awareness , enhance the sense of responsibility of the people in the fight against these social vices .
Over the past years , the media , the mass organizations at central and local levels , have devoted tremendous efforts to communicate the State 's policy on the prevention of prostitution to the people ( through articles , radio and TV programs , training courses , seminars … ) , forming strong public opinion against this crime , and at the same time , applauding good models and best practices .
The Women 's Unions at all levels have made it clear that women are always the victims and the most disadvantaged in prostitution - related activities , which impedes the achievement of gender equality and socio-economic development goals .
Local Women 's Unions have equipped women with needed tools and skills to recognize plots and attempts to traffic women for prostitution , and encouraged women to work with others in the community to prevent and fight against such attempts .
Throughout the country , movements to build prostitution - free and drugs - free villages and communes have been expanded , and thus helped to prevent these evils from spreading .
- The handling of prostitution - related cases : In this connection , following are some figures provided by the Supreme People 's Procuracy and Supreme People 's Court , in the 2000 - 2002 period :
+ harbouring of prostitution : the Courts have tried 2,470 out of 2,932 cases , with 3,224 accused persons .
146 of them received sentences over 10 years of imprisonment ; 7 - 10 years for 313 ; under 7 years for 2468 , and probation for 292 .
+ procuring : 358 out of 437 cases have been tried with 483 accused persons .
The punitive measures for prostitution - related offences have increased in severity .
Vietnam is still working on improving its legal tools to prevent and suppress these crimes more effectively .
According to Vietnamese laws , all prostitution - related activities are strictly forbidden , and all violations of the laws will be punished accordingly .
Persons forced into prostitution are protected by the law , and anyone who forces others into prostitution shall be subject to criminal prosecution .
- Education , treatment and reintegration of prostitutes : From 2001 to the end of December 2003 , the Labour , Invalid and Social Affairs Ministry and Departments have provided treatment and education for 14,839 prostitutes , and provided vocational training and created jobs for 8,000 .
Apart from receiving regular education , these persons have also been diagnosed and treated for sexually transmitted diseases as well as other sickness .
HIV / AIDS counselling has also been provided .
The Vocational Training Centers have paid special attention to making the training programs better fit for former prostitutes , bearing in mind the characteristics and needs of these special students .
But all programs aim to accelerate their reintegration and to help them find jobs .
The State even provides 400,000 VND in allowance to these persons as they finish the re-education term and return home .
The allowance , though small , reflects how much the authorities care for them , and also helps them in rebuilding their life in a healthier way .
The local women 's unions take the responsibility to receive them , facilitate their access to loans for economic activities , and encourage their participation in the unions ' activities .
In the community , the “ once-prostitutes ” are treated equally as other citizens .
The local authorities and mass organizations have persuaded agencies and companies in their localities to recruit , provide vocational training and financial support to these persons .
The women unions ' anti-social - evils clubs have also been a place for these persons to go to , where they can learn more about social vices , health care , household economics and poverty reduction .
Recently in October 2003 , the first Center for Assistance in Marriage with foreigners has been established in Ho Chi Minh City in order to protect the rights of Vietnamese citizens , particularly women , and prevent marriage brokers for economic gains .
- International cooperation has been expanded in an effort to halt the spread of prostitution and trafficking in women .
Over the past four years , Vietnam has taken part in some international projects , including two regional projects ( Project on the Prevention of Trafficking in Women and Children in the Mekong Sub-region ; ILO / IPEC project for community - based capacity building , awareness raising and job creation for women and children ) .
These projects have helped facilitate better collaborations among countries in the fight against trafficking in women and children .
Outstanding problems and solutions
Numerous difficulties still confront the fight against prostitution , including the increasing sophistication of prostitution - related activities , the income gap among the regions , unemployment , and the easy - going lifestyle of some .
To make the fight against prostitution more effective , relevant agencies will continue their work on the implementation of the Ordinance on the Prevention and Suppression of Prostitution .
Comprehensive measures will be taken at all levels of government , with relevant agencies held more accountable for their responsibilities .
Monitoring and evaluation will also be strengthened , while violations will be punished .
Steps will be taken to provide more information , education and counselling to the communities , and build communes free of social vices .
Employment and poverty reduction policies will by more effectively implemented to help the vulnerable groups .
Relevant agencies will conduct reviews , draw lessons and replicate good models in accordance with Directive No.25 / CT - TTg by the Prime Minister , which requires relevant agencies to communicate the Ordinance to the people from all strata , encourage mass organizations and the people to take part in condemning and detecting all prostitution - related activities .
Article 7 Exercising women 's rights to equality in political and public life
Ensuring women 's rights to vote and stand for elections
Article 126 of the 1999 Penal Code provides for punitive measures against acts of infringement upon the rights to vote and stand for election of citizens as follows : Those who resort to deception , buying off , coercion or other tricks to obstruct the exercise of citizen 's right to vote and / or the right to stand for election shall be subject to warning , non-custodial reform for up to one year or a prison term of between three months and one year .
Article 10 of the revised 2001 Law on Elections of National Assembly Deputy stipulates that the number of female National Assembly Deputies is proposed by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly at the request of the presidium of the Center Committee of the Viet Nam Women 's Union in order to ensure a rational proportion of female deputies .
Article 14 of the 2003 Law on Elections of Members of People 's Councils stipulates that the Standing Board of the People 's Councils at provincial , district and communal levels propose the structure , component and number of members of People 's Councils , which guarantee a rational proportion of female members .
The National Strategy for the Advancement of Vietnamese Women to 2010 set out the target as follows : Proportion of female National Assembly Deputies , Tenure 11th ( 2002 - 2007 ) of 30 % and the following tenure of 33 % or higher ; female members of People 's Councils Tenure 2004 - 2009 at provincial level of 28 % and the next tenure of 30 % ; district level of 23 % and the next tenure of 25 % ; communal and ward level of 18 % and the next tenure of 20 % .
To realize the above - mentioned provisions , a number of specific measures have been taken at various levels to raise the proportion of 11th female parliamentarians , including communication and outreach activities , distribution of leaflets to encourage women 's participation in leadership and National Assembly and organization of meetings with constituents for female candidates .
The National Committee for the Advancement of Vietnamese Women organized 6 training courses for 216 female candidates for the 11th National Assembly to provide them with knowledge and necessary skills and raise their confidence for winning the election .
As a result , the proportion of female parliamentarians of the 11th National Assembly reached 27.31 % , which is higher than the previous tenure ( 18.5 % and 26.22 % for the 9th and 10th tenure respectively ) and puts at the top position in Asia in terms of female proportion in Parliament .
In addition , the female turnouts of the 11th National Assembly election reached 99.76 % ( that of the 10th National Assembly was 99.09 % ) .
Compared to the previous periods , female parliamentarians not only increase in number but also in quality .
Female MPs with BA degrees or higher were 58.9 % , 87.28 % and 90.44 % for the 9th , 10th and 11th National Assembly respectively .
This quantitative and qualitative improvement indicates the capability and contribution of women in the country 's political life .
Therefore , the rights to vote and to stand for elections of the Vietnamese women are in the main ensured .
However , there remains some constraints , such as limited awareness of the society on the importance of women 's participation in the political life and community activities ; absence of mechanism and favourable conditions for women to fully exercise their rights to vote and stand for elections ; lack of self - confidence and family support in standing for elections , especially for women in rural areas and those of ethnic minority people .
In view of this , active and integrated solutions will be taken to raise women 's participation in the elected bodies in the upcoming tenures .
7.2 Women 's right in state , economic and social governance
The 1998 Ordinance on Civil Servants and the revised 2003 Ordinance on Civil Servants provides for a non-discriminatory treatment between men and women in recruitment , employment , appointment , change of salary scale , commendation and bonuses and entitlements to male and female civil servants in State administrative agencies and public service delivery agencies .
To guide the implementation of this Ordinance , the Government promulgated on 12 October 2000 Decree Number 56/2000 / ND - CP , amending Paragraph 2 , Article 6 of Decree Number 95/1998/ND-CP on 17 November 1998 by the Government on the regulations of recruitment , employment and management of civil servants , according to which the qualified age is between 18 - 40 , equally applied to men and women ( in the past , it was between 18 - 35 for women ) .
This amendment removes the difference in recruitment age between men and women .
In fact , the proportion of female civil servants now stands at 68.7 %.
On 19 February 2003 , the Prime Minister signed Decision No 27/2003 / QD - TTg issuing the Regulation on appointment , reappointment , rotation , resignation , and resignation of civil servants .
Under this Regulation , the qualified age for the first appointment does not exceed 55 for men and 50 for women .
For the positions of director - general and deputy head of division at district level or equivalent positions , the qualified age is not over 45 , regardless of gender .
The Prime Minister issued Decision No 69/2003/QD - TTg approving the Plan for building and improving the capacity of civil servants for the first phase between 2003 and 2005 .
The objective of the Plan is to build a pool of administrative civil servants with appropriate quantity and structure , characterized by professionalism , modernity , high sense of morality , sufficient capability for discharging duties and dedication to serving the national development and the people .
To establish a professionally qualified pool of civil servants , meeting the demand of raised productivity of the State apparatus , the Prime Minister issued Decision No 161/2003 / QD - TTg on 04 August 2003 issuing Regulation on training of civil servants , which is aimed at providing them with the knowledge of political science , state management skills , professional skills and other supporting knowledge .
These regulations have been implemented in all government agencies of all levels .
The implementation of the Grassroots Democracy Decree at communal - ward levels and in offices mentioned in previous reports continued to be promoted , which facilitates the equal participation of women in discussions and decision making on local socio- economic issues and the rights of the employee .
In 2001 , the Government instructed the review of the implementation of Decision No 163 / HDTB - QD on 19 October 1988 of the Ministers ' Council ( now the Government ) .
This Decision stipulated the responsibilities of local authorities to ensure the participation of the Viet Nam Women 's Union in state governance .
As a result , there have been significant changes in awareness , attitude , responsibilities and actions of authorities of all levels related to the role and position of the Viet Nam Woman 's Union and the capability of women in the country 's reform .
Women are encouraged to participate in social activities and effectively discharge their responsibilities in state and social governance .
The women 's union at all levels has actively coordinated with ministries , agencies and localities in the process of law making and formulation of policies and socio-economic strategies and in the oversight of the implementation of woman - related policies .
To further build on these achievements and reaffirm the position and role of the Women 's Union in state governance , the Government issued Decree No 19/2003 / ND - CP on 7 March 2003 to substitute the Decision No 163 / QD - HDBT , which provides for more detailed provisions on the responsibility of administrative agencies of all levels on facilitating the participation of Women 's Union in social activities and governance .
The Viet Nam Women 's Union has developed a plan for the nation - wide implementation of this Decree and is preparing a new working mechanism between the Government and the Viet Nam Women 's Union .
The Government and relevant agencies have made great efforts in narrowing the gap between men and women in leadership positions .
However , the ratio between male and female decision - makers remains unbalanced .
Between 1997 and 2003 , the proportions of women in key positions at national and provincial levels are as follows : Women holding ministerial portfolio and equivalent positions increased from 7.9 % to 11.9 % ; deputy - ministerial positions and equivalent fell from 9.1 % to 8.1 % ; Chairwomen of Provincial People 's Committees dropped from 3.3 % to 1.6 % ; Vice - Chairwomen of Provincial People 's Committee increased from 10.1 % to 11.7 % .
As such , in the past 6 years only the proportion of women holding ministerial positions and equivalent saw some increase .
However , this proportion remains modest .
The number of chairwomen of Provincial People 's Committees decreased remarkably and is too small in comparison with men .
7.3 Women 's rights to participate in political and social organizations
Compared to the third and fourth combined reports , woman 's right to participate in political and social organizations continued to be boosted .
The proactive involvement of women in political and social organizations significantly contributed to national development .
However , the proportion of women in leadership positions of mass organizations remains small , despite some improvement reflected in woman 's memberships in various institutions : Center Committee of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union 25/134 or 18.65 % ; Vietnam Farmers ' Union is 15/86 or 17.2 % ; Viet Nam National Fatherland Front 34/198 or 17 % ; Vietnamese Red Cross Society 28/105 or 26.6 %.
The proportion of women in the Party is also on the rise , accounting for 35, 7 % of new Party members in 2002 .
7.4 Directions to increase woman 's participation in political and community activities in the future
The participation of Vietnamese women is yet to be commensurate with their capability and meet the demand of the reform process .
As such , effective measures will be taken to eliminate remaining weaknesses .
Under the instruction of the Party Center Committee , central and local agencies held meetings to review the implementation of the 1994 Directive No 37 - CT / TW on the woman personnel work in the new context .
In early 2004 , a national review of this Directive was organized , which provided an important opportunity for agencies at all levels to assess the achievements , highlight key problems , analyze the causes and draw lessons , as well as recommending concrete measures to improve planning , training and employment of women .
These reviews helped bring about a significant change in the awareness and behaviour of agencies of all levels with regard to woman personnel work , which is an important part of the personnel strategy .
The Women 's Union is expected to submit to the Party Central Committee a new draft Resolution aimed at reaching out more to women and woman cadres in the new context .
Article 8 Women 's participation in international activities
As mentioned in the previous reports , Vietnamese laws and state 's policies ensure the equal rights of men and women to participate in international activities .
Especially , under the policy of expanded foreign relations and proactive international economic integration , Vietnamese women have more favourable conditions to participate in these activities .
8.1 Women in the diplomatic service
As a Government agency in charge of foreign relations , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs pays much attention to ensuring the equal participation of men and women in international activities , as well as recruiting and training woman staff at all levels .
The Commission for the Advancement of Women of the Ministry headed by a Deputy Minister was established .
The Ministry adopted a Plan of Action for the advancement of Women in the period 2000 - 2005 , which sets the targets as follows : the proportion of women in the whole diplomatic service of 30 % ; women in key positions of 11 - 20 % ; woman heads of representative missions of 20 % and higher ; and one woman Minister Assistant .
At present , the percentage of women in the diplomatic service accounts for 28 % , of which 28 % is working abroad .
The proportion of women having post - graduate degrees is 14 / 64 , women with Master 's degree and PhD are 80/227 and 5/41 respectively .
During the 2000 - 2003 period , the number of women appointed as directors and deputy directors increased from 10 to 15 .
There are now 11 female heads of divisions .
In total , the number of women in leadership positions is as follows : 1 department director ( out of 22 directors ) , 5 deputy directors ( out of 57 ) , 2 heads of divisions ( out of 22 ) and 9 deputy heads of divisions ( out of 32 ) .
Training and improving the capability of woman staff in the diplomatic service always received due attention .
In 2002 , women staff accounted for 38 % and 32 % of the total number of staff sent abroad or received training at home for postgraduate studies .
Notably , the proportion of female students qualified in the entrance exam into the Institute for International Relations has been on the rise .
The figures for the Term 26 ( year 2000 ) , 27 ( Year 2001 ) , 28 ( Year 2002 ) and 29 ( Year 2003 ) were 137/55 , 129/66 , 154/68 and 169/60 respectively .
At Vietnamese representative missions abroad , the equal rights of woman staff regarding work , tenure , titles and salary have been fully ensured .
During the period 2000 - 2003 , three out of 19 ambassadors appointed were women .
The proportion of women working full - time abroad is increasing , and now stands at 143/571 , or 30 % .
8.2 Woman 's participation in external activities
With the policy of openness , the proportion of women working for international organizations is on the rise , averaging over 50 % .
In 2002 and 2003 , the figures were 56 % and 56.55 % respectively .
Around 40 % of project officers and assistants are women .
In 2002 , the figure was 50.86 % .
The percentage of women holding other positions such as secretary and interpreter was over 35 % , even reaching 45 % in 2000 but declining afterwards .
The proportion of women doing supporting work at project offices remains low , averaging 17 % and tends to drop .
In multilateral activities , many women working for government agencies , people 's friendship associations and mass organizations had opportunities to represent their Government at international forums and external activities .
The participation of women in these multilateral and bilateral external activities was improved both quantitatively and qualitatively .
Depending on the activities ' nature , the increase of women 's participation ranges between from 40 % to 50 % .
Many female officials had the opportunity to accompany leaders of State , Party and Government in visits to foreign countries or international conferences .
Many of them hold key positions in important bilateral and multilateral negotiations , including those for Vietnam 's WTO accession .
Especially , to encourage more women to participate in and benefit from economic integration activities , the National Committee on the Advancement of Women formulated the Document guiding the Implementation of the Framework for Women Integration within APEC .
Seven Ministries and agencies in charge of APEC activities also completed the Plan of Action on Women Integration within APEC .
Regarding ASEAN , Viet Nam played an active role in ASEAN Women Committee .
Regarding people - to - people diplomacy , the participation of the Viet Nam Women 's Union is highly appreciated .
For the past 5 years , women accounted for 50 % of millions of batches of people taking part in activities for peace , solidarity and friendship .
Thanks to the connections with more than 70 countries and 350 organizations , the Viet Nam Women 's Union has promoted the cooperation between Vietnamese women and world women and people for common goals of gender equality , development and peace .
The Union also helped solicit multi-sided support for the Vietnamese women and children .
The talents and contribution of Vietnamese women helped raise their own credit and position in international relations , which were highly appreciated domestically and internationally .
This is partly reflected in the number of Vietnamese women appointed as regional representatives of various international organizations and presented international and regional awards .
However , the proportion of women participating in international activities remains modest .
Only 30 % of ASEAN activities enjoys the participation of women .
One of the obstacles is women 's foreign language skills .
In the future , State agencies will focus more on training and appointment of women in the diplomatic service .
Article 9 Issue of nationality
As affirmed in the previous reports , Vietnamese laws and regulations , including 1998 Law on Nationality , are consistent in ensuring the equality between men and women regarding nationality .
During the past years , the Vietnamese State has strictly and effectively observed all provisions of laws regarding nationality and in fact , ensured the equality between men and women in applying for , renouncing or retaining Vietnamese citizenship without any discrimination against women .
Vietnamese citizens , men and women alike , have the right to retain their Vietnamese nationality after marriage , divorce or annulment of illegal marriage with foreigners .
The wife or husband retains their original citizenship regardless of the fact that the other partner applies for or loses Vietnamese citizenship .
During the period 2000 - 2003 , the Vietnamese State has accepted 12,818 cases giving up Vietnamese citizenship to attain foreign citizenship , including 73 people currently living in Viet Nam .
Among these cases , 67 are women , constituting 91.7 %.
In 2002 , 1,553 people gave up Vietnamese citizenship .
However , the trend of renouncing Vietnamese citizenship has declined thanks to better legal framework , improved national and individual economic conditions , easy travel and higher community spirit .
The Vietnamese State strictly observed the Law on Nationality to ensure women 's equal right with regard to their children 's nationality .
Children with both Vietnamese parents are granted Vietnamese citizenship regardless of their place of birth within or outside Vietnam .
Children with one Vietnamese parent are granted Vietnamese citizenship with agreement in writing of both parents at the time of birth registration .
Children with Vietnamese mothers , and non-citizenship or unidentified fathers , are granted Vietnamese citizenship , regardless of their place of birth within or outside Vietnam .
Provisions of Vietnamese Laws regarding nationality and its implementation by relevant agencies are all conformed to the Convention on Nationality .
Article 10 Equality in education
10.1 Policies and Goals
The Vietnamese Government has adopted a number legal documents on education , including Decree No 43/2000 / ND - CP on 30 August 2000 guiding the implementation of the Education Law , Decree Number 35/2001/ ND- CP on 9 July 2001 on policies towards teachers , managing staff in specialized schools and in areas with particularly difficult socio - economic conditions ; and Decree No 88/2001 / ND - CP on 22 November 2001 on universalization of elementary education .
In 2001 , the Prime Minister issued Decision Number 201/2001 / QD - TTg approving the Strategy on Education Development in 2001 - 2010 , which set the goals of making a fundamental change in education quality ; ensuring social equality in education and creating better education opportunities for people of all social strata , especially those in needy areas .
In 2003 , the Prime Minister adopted Decision No 26/2003 / QD - TTg approving of the National Target Programme on Education and Training by 2005 .
The " National Plan of Action on Education for All " for 2003 - 2015 set gender equality as a priority with concrete goals of “ eliminating gender inequality primary and secondary education by 2005 , achieving gender equality in education by 2015 with guarantee of female students ' full and equal access to education and of their completion of education with good quality ” .
The provisions of the above - mentioned legal documents continue to conform to the principle of equality in education while creating mechanisms and necessary conditions for women and girl children to enjoy equality in education and training .
10.2 Ensuring the equality of opportunity and learning conditions for men and women
As mentioned in the previous reports , there is no discrimination between male and female students at all levels , from preschool to post -graduate , and in all kinds of schools .
They enjoy the same conditions , such as classrooms , curricula , scholarship and financial support .
State budget for education has unceasingly increased in the past years , standing at 15 % , 15.6 % , 15.8 % and 16.2 % for 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , and 2003 respectively .
Thanks to the investment of the State and support of international organizations , education facilities were improved substantially .
There is a primary school in every village and hamlet , junior secondary school in every commune or between communes and senior secondary school in every district , which provide easy access to education for all , including women and girl children .
A national education system , which is complete , integrated and diverse has been established with all levels of education , from preschool to post -graduate .
Diversification of the education system in terms of forms , modality and resources was allowed , thus opening up greater education opportunities for the people , especially women of all ages .
The scale of education continued to be extended at almost all levels and disciplines .
The academic year of 2002 - 2003 saw 22 million people going to school .
The proportion students learning in non-state institutions was on the increase , accounting for 76.5 % of kindergarten , 58.3 % of preschool , 31.8 % senior secondary school and 11 % university in 2002 - 2003 .
The proportion of women and schoolgirls taking part in education of all forms is about 38 - 40 % in 2002 .
There are four forms of non-regular education for adults , including illiteracy elimination and post-literacy education ; customized education ; periodic refresher courses , training courses to update and improve knowledge and skills ; programmes to obtain certificates of the national education system , such as in - service training , distance learning and guided self - learning .
As such , education opportunities for women have increased significantly .
Social equality in general education is basically ensured .
Education in the areas of the ethnic minority people saw a marked improvement .
By 2002 - 2003 , there are 1,545 boarding schools for ethnic minorities at all levels .
Teaching in the scripts of the ethnic people was stepped up with 8 languages .
As a result , the percentage of ethnic illiterates has fallen and by 2002 stood at 22.6 % . The enrollment of ethnic pupils is on the rise compared to the year 2000 .
The proportion of schoolgirls , however , is small , standing at about 10 % .
In 2002 , the number of mountainous girls going to school was only 10 - 15 % .
The main reason is that girls have to work to help their families ; find it hard to go to boarding schools far away from home ; and traditionally get married early .
As such , in the future , the Ministry of Education and Training will review related legal documents to raise the enrollments of girls .
In addition , relevant agencies will organize various activities using mass - media to raise public awareness of the benefits of education for girl children .
The proportion of ethnic woman teachers and headmasters in remote and ethnic minority areas will also be raised , and education quality in these areas be improved .
10.3 Results of education and training for women
Built on the achievements in illiteracy elimination and universalization of primary education , Vietnam is heading for the universalization of junior secondary school education .
The number of provinces having accomplished this target was 12/61 in 2002 and 19/61 in 2003 .
The academic year of 2002 - 2003 saw the participation of 134,708 people in post-literacy courses . Each year , one million people are given the opportunities to take part in regular education .
According to the survey on the living standard of households by the General Department of Statistics , 92.13 % of the population above ten years old is literate , but the women 's rate is only 89.31 % .
The average number of years going to school of women is 5.3 while that of men is 6.5 ( figure of 2003 ) .
By and large , equality in primary education in Vietnam is ensured .
Education level of women and girls was improved in the past three years .
In 2002 - 2000 , the number of school enrollments reached 18 million with girls making up almost an equal share of 47.49 % for primary level , 47.26 % for junior secondary level and 47.36 % for senior secondary level .
These rates of girls ' graduation are 47.57 % , 48.17 % and 47.17 % respectively .
The proportion of girls going to school at right age is lower than that of boys and girl drop - outs is higher than boys .
In 2001 - 2002 , the percentage of female students in science and technology colleges and universities increased , though not substantially .
This reflects the positive change in social attitude towards women 's careers ( see table 4.4 of the Annex ) .
10.4 Women working in the area of education - training
By the year 2002 , 650,000 female employees are working in education and training , constituting 70 % of the total number of staff .
In 2002 - 2003 , the proportion of woman staff were 99.6 % , 78 % , 68 % , 56 % , 42.5 % and 39.7 % for preschools , primary schools , junior secondary schools , senior secondary schools , vocational schools and universities respectively .
In the Ministry of Education and Training , there is one Deputy Minister , one director , 6 deputy directors and 11 directors of provincial department who are women .
The percentage of woman headmasters is 100 % for preschool level , 34.31 % for primary level , 21.08 % for secondary level , 7.92 for university level and 6.7 % for college level .
In 2002 , the proportions of woman professors and associate - professors are 3.54 and 7.24 % respectively .
These figures reflect the positive change of woman participation in the education area .
But this is yet to be commensurate with their capability .
In order to improve the working conditions for female teachers in needy areas , the Ministry of Education and Training has issued a number of concrete regulations on such incentives as mobile allowances , allowances for teaching in ethnic languages , allowances for changing zones and on secondment , etc .
Many areas have policies to encourage woman staff to improve their skills and qualifications or build public houses for woman teachers .
At present , 51 out of 64 provinces grant social insurance to teachers of non-state education system with the participation of including 32 % woman teachers .
10.5 Gender- bias in textbooks
Some traces of gender - bias attitude still remain in school textbooks .
Images and concepts introduced in textbooks still depict the traditional role of women and girl children in doing housework , manual work and farming .
In addition , they are described as shy people , who are dependent on the help of others and inferior to men .
Boys and men , on the other hand , are illustrated as scholars , explorers and engineers or skilled workers ; they are strong , capable of using techniques well , reasonable independent and respectful .
These are the shortcomings in textbooks of grades 1 , 2 , 6 and 7 which have been reviewed and changed with equal images of boys and girls , stressing the right to equal treatment between them and criticizing acts of discriminatory nature against women in families and society or in peer relationship .
The elimination of gender prejudice in education and training will be further boosted , guided by the Ministry of Education and Training through plans and projects of textbook development , which also mainstreams gender issue .
At present , the entire education and training sector has been implementing various national plans in the period 2000 - 2005 .
The main direction of these plans is to develop and use new textbooks for school level ; raise the qualifications of and standardize teachers ; ensure the availability of teaching facilities , develop pre-school education , especially in 222 communes where preschools are still absent and in 323 communes where there is only one preschool class attached to primary school ; and improve education for ethnic minority people .
The active implementation of the National Target Program on Education and Training , together with the above - mentioned efforts of the Ministry , has continued to contribute tremendously to the guarantee of equal rights for women and child girls in education and training .
The Ministry of Education and Training has drafted an amendment to the Law on Education , which offers more educational opportunities for the people .
The draft is to be submitted to the National Assembly .
The Ministry of Education and Training is also finalizing the project on furthering socialization of education and training for the Government 's approval .
The realization of those programmes will further offer equal rights for women and girls in the field of education and training .
Article 11 Equality in employment
Compared to the last period , the issue of ensuring equal rights for women in the field of employment in Vietnam has been improved .
This is thanks to the amendments on policy and law provisions as well as the implementation of active measures to assist the female work force .
11.1 New regulations
Besides the legal documents mentioned in the above articles , especially in article 4 , the State of Vietnam has promulgated other laws and legal documents to ensure employment equality for women .
Those laws and legal documents include :
- The 2002 revised Labor Code , which has amendments to address issues related to female workers , such as social insurance , salary , labor safety , labor discipline duration , as stated in the report on the implementation of article 4 of the Convention .
- Government Decree 02/2001/ND-CP on January 9 , 2001 on Vocational Training stipulating that female trainees do not have to compensate for vocational training fee when terminating the training contract if they have documents issued by health authorities at district level or higher certifying that prolonging such a contract would have bad effect on the fetus ; after maternity leave , if she wishes and is eligible , she can continue the training .
- Government Decree 114/2002/ND-CP on December 31 , 2002 on salary matters reaffirming the equal rights on salary payment .
It provides for that if female workers do the same job as male workers , they are equally paid .
- Government Decree 01/2003/ND-CP on January 9 , 2003 amending the Charter on Social Insurance .
Accordingly , the scope of application of the Charter has been expanded to cover workers in collective and private economic sectors , which employ a significant number of female workers .
- Government Decree 33/2003/ND-CP on April 2 , 2003 stipulating that disciplinary measures are not applicable to women workers who are pregnant , on maternity leave , raising child under 12 months of age and male workers raising child under 12 months of age .
- Government Decree 39/2003/ND-CP on April 18 , 2003 providing details on the implementation of some articles on employment of the Labor Code , in which the Ministry of Labor , War Invalids and Social Affairs is tasked to study and submit to the Government a policy to assist women in employment .
The State continues to take active measures to ensure women 's equal rights in the field of employment .
Women 's equal rights in the field of employment continue to be promoted along with the national process of ( Doi Moi ) reforms .
The State of Vietnam has taken many measures to create new employment opportunities , such as improving domestic and foreign investment policies and implementing socio-economic programs ; continuing the National Target Program on Hunger Eradication , Poverty Reduction and Employment ; expanding the labor and expert export market ; adjusting vocational training programmes in accordance with market demand .
Surveys on labor and employment over the years show that the number of women participating in frequent economic activity has increased .
In 2002 , women at the working age accounted for 59.55 % of the population , 64.74 % in urban area and 57.79 % in rural area .
At the time of the survey done in July 7 , 2002 , female workers aged 15 upward participated in frequent economic activity accounted for 49.30 % - an increase of 2.49 % compared to 2001 - 48.78 % in urban area and 49.46 % in rural area .
In terms of distribution in economic sectors , women accounted for 48.20 % and had a high share in such sectors as processing with 48. 72 % , fishery with 49.78 % , trade with 63.75 % , hotel and restaurant with 68 % .
Therefore , the ratio of women participating in economic activities is quite high , especially in service and trade , which is along the right shift in the economic structure toward sectors that contribute significantly to the fast growth of GDP .
During the past years , jobs created have been on a steady increase : 14.2 m in 2002 , 1.52 m in 2003 , of which the ratio of women was quite high .
Within that overall result , jobs created from implemented socio - economic development programs accounted for 78.6 % , and 21.4 % of those were created by the national fund for employment .
Annually , the government spends 200 billion Vietnamese dong of its budget on job creation .
According to the new regulations , starting from 2003 , households , co-operatives , small and medium sized enterprises can borrow loans of under 15 m Vietnamese dong from the national fund for employment without mortgage .
Especially priorities are given to disabled people and enterprises using a large number of female workers .
By expanding the household and farm based economic sector , developing craft villages and products for export , promoting private sector , industrial parks and processing zone , new jobs are created .
The expansion of market for labor and expert export to Southeast Asia is also a good solution to job creation in general and to the female labour force in particular .
From 2001 - 2003 , Vietnam exported 158,000 workers and experts , 35 % of whom are women .
Unemployment among women at working age in urban areas has dropped compared to the period when the 3rd and 4th combined report was submitted but the result is yet to be sustainable : 6.25 % in 2000 , 6.85 % in 2002 and 7.22 % in 2003 , whereas the overall rate is 5.78 % .
The utilization of working hours among rural women at working age has increased rather slowly , 73.71 % in 2000 , 75.25 % in 2002 and 77.74 % in 2003 , lower than the overall rate of 77.94 % .
There is also a difference in sex distribution by sectors and lines of business .
The ratio of women is still lower in some sectors and lines of business ( View index 3.6 )
- As far as vocational training is concerned , compared to the period of the previous report , vocational training has developed dramatically both in quality and quantity .
From 2001 - 2003 , over 2.9 m people were trained , 30 % of which was women .
More fields of vocational training were opened , many of which are suitable for women .
Moreover , local authorities have started to invest considerably in vocational training centers . The training quality has improved remarkably , thus meeting the demands of the labor market .
90 % of the trainees of some vocational training areas such as post and telecommunications , transportation and tailor , have jobs after graduation , in which the ratio of female graduates was quite high .
Vocational schools have increased in number and are located widely across the country , thus meeting better the increasing demand .
The number of trained female workers has mounted , thus reducing the gap with the number of trained male workers .
However , the professional skills of women workers are lower than that of male workers , and women accounted for ¾ of the unskilled job ( according to 2001 survey by the Ministry of Labor , Invalids and Social Affairs and ILO ) .
- Regarding retirement age : the combined 3rd and 4th report has touched upon the matter of retirement age for men and women , and has suggested that the pension policy be revised .
Taking into consideration such suggestion , the Government has asked the Ministry of Labor , Invalids , and Social Affairs to collaborate with agencies concerned to conduct a study on the retirement age of female workers .
The findings showed different views on this matter and over 70 % of those asked thought that the regulation on retirement age was reasonable .
Therefore , the National Assembly decided not to change the retirement age , 55 for female and 60 for male in the recent revised the Labor Code .
However , the number of years with paid social insurance , which is used as the basis for the calculation of retirement age , has dropped from 30 to 25 for women so as to match with the retirement age .
In the immediate , in order to make it possible for competent and professional people to contribute more to the society , the Government issued Decree 71 / ND - CP on November 23 , 2000 stipulating the extension of the number of working years of officials and civil servants who reach retirement age .
Accordingly , senior experts , doctors of science , professors , associate professors , regardless male or female , can continue working for 1 to 5 more years if needed by employers .
- With regard to breast - feeding leave , according to the regulations , female workers can take 60 minutes off every day for 12 months to breast - feed the baby and still get paid .
This policy has allowed female workers to arrange breast - feeding time suitable with their personal conditions and their work .
However , the application of such regulations has proven quite difficult for females working in production lines , far from home or with children in distanced day - care center .
To compensate for them , the State has allowed the conversion of unused breast - feeding time into working days to be paid with allowance for female workers .
- Concerning social insurance , the Charter on Social Insurance has been revised in 2003 to include more provisions beneficial to female workers as mentioned above .
According to the current regulations , those obliged to buy social insurance include employees of enterprises of different economic sectors including private and non-state ones .
By 2002 , about 4.4 m people had bought social insurance , of which 3.8 m were from the State sector and accounted for 86.4 % of the total buyers .
At present , the number of female workers buying social insurance is very high ( 50.5 % ) , 52.2 % of which belongs to the public service sector .
However , workers from non-state sectors only account for 15 to 20 % .
The main reason is employers do not strictly abide by the law , and authorities concerned do not conduct frequent inspections to promptly deal with violations .
Now relevant agencies are helping the Government to finalize the policy on social insurance for voluntary retirement , so that workers from all economic sectors , including farmers and freelance workers can have pension .
This policy when implemented will give 30 million workers the opportunity to join the scheme .
- Women involved in household economy enjoy the same rights as provided for men .
There are no other specific regulations .
In recent years , the Government of Vietnam has carried out many measures to develop the household economic sector , especially in rural areas .
Each household is considered as an economic unit , creating job for its own members , attracting local labor , thus helping reduce poverty and raise people 's living standards .
Models of small credit loans from job creation , poverty reduction and farm economy programs have provided women with both job and higher income .
Moreover , mass organizations also pay great attention to women .
Particularly , Women Unions at various levels are allowed by the Government to act as credit guarantors for their members ' loans .
Every year , 30 % of the total small projects in the country are funded by loans of this kind .
The average income of a person involved in household economy is around 40 - 60 % and this helps increase their personal as well as family income .
- As far as support services for workers are concerned , together with investment for economic growth , the Government of Vietnam also pays great attention to improving social services to meet the increasing demands of the people .
Women have enjoyed a wide range of social services such as day - care center , kindergarten , domestic work , processed food , etc .
At present , the system of day - care center and kindergarten is being expanded under various forms , for example public , semi-public and private in both city and rural areas .
In cities , the need for domestic workers has increased .
This has created more job opportunities for women , especially for those in rural areas and female students .
Housemaid or domestic worker has been recognized by and protected under the Labor Code .
Some outstanding issues and solutions
In reality , shortcomings exist in the implementation of policies towards female workers including the issue of their retirement age as mentioned above .
Rural female workers have yet to enjoy fully policies on social insurance .
Occupational safety and sanitation well as production tools are in poor conditions .
The level of occupational disease is high .
Oversight over the implementation of the Labor Code in enterprises is not effective .
At present , the Ministry of Labor , War Invalids and Social Affairs has put forward measures to address these issues , mainly focusing on :
Studying the revision of some articles of Government Decree 23 - 1996 / ND - CP issued on April 18 , 1996 to submit to the Government .
The revision will be made in the following direction : the State allocates part of its vocational training budget for vocational schools to provide training on an additional skills for female workers in case of contingency ; provide for some items on which enterprises can use money from tax reduction to spend for female workers ; Boards on women 's work at grassroots level can participate in making decisions on female workers ' rights such as salary increase , schooling , rewards , etc . Formulating the social insurance scheme for voluntary retirement and submit to the Government for approval so that everyone can get access to social insurance .
Studying and submitting to the Government for approval a new solution to female workers ' retirement age .
Building and guiding the implementation of regulations on occupational safety and sanitation in agriculture , craft village using large quantity of female workers ; promoting education and dissemination of knowledge on safety and sanitation requirements for authorities at different levels so that they can effectively oversee the compliance by employers as well as employees .
Improving monitoring and inspection over the implementation of policies towards female workers , especially in non-state sectors ; amending and supplementing acts of violation of policies towards female workers in the Decree on penalties for violations of the Labor Code ; building a system of rewards and punishment for enterprises ' performance in implementing policies on female workers .
Article 12 Women 's equal access to health care services
12.1 Guidelines , policies on public healthcare :
On 22 January 2001 , the Secretary Board of the Party 's Central Committee issued Directive 06 - CT / TW on strengthening the grassroots healthcare system with a view to improving the quality of primary healthcare for the people .
The resolution of the Ninth Congress of the Communist Party of Viet Nam ( in 2001 ) put emphasis on increasing the equity in terms of access to healthcare services , continuing to pursue national healthcare targets , raising the quality of healthcare services at all levels ; giving special attention to improving healthcare for children , war victims , the poor , ethnic minorities , those living in former revolutionary bases , as well as remote and mountainous areas , and reducing child malnutrition and under -five - year - old child mortality as well as pregnancy related mortality .
Institutionalizing these lines of the Party , the State has promulgated various legal documents with the aim of ensuring equal rights of all people including women to quality healthcare services , thus improving the quality of the population .
The Standing Committee of the National Assembly also passed the Ordinance on the Elderly ( in 2000 ) and the Ordinance on Population ( in 2003 ) .
As for the first time , the gender issue has been clearly stipulated in the Ordinance on Population like prohibiting of sex selection in any form ; stipulating the State 's responsibilities in making policies and taking measures to eliminate all forms of gender - biased discrimination ; and securing the pro-activeness , voluntariness and equality of all persons and families in reproductive healthcare and choosing few - children family pattern .
The Government promulgated Decree 74/2000/ND-CP on trading and using breast milk substitutes so as to protect and encourage breastfeeding ; Decree 12/2003/ND-CP on artificial pregnancy ; Decree 104/2003 / ND - CP providing detailed guidelines on the implementation of some articles in the Ordinance on Population .
The Prime Minister has issued the Decision to approve the National Strategy for reproductive healthcare to 2010 ; the National Nutrition Strategy to 2010 ; the Strategy for public healthcare in the 2001 - 2010 period ; the Vietnamese Population Strategy in the 2001 - 2010 period ( Decision147 / 2000 / QD - TTg ) ; the National Target Programme on prevention and treatment of dangerous social diseases , epidemics and AIDS to 2005 ( Decision 190/2001 / QD - TTg ) ; the National Target Programme on Population and Family Planning to 2005 ( Decision 18/2002 / QD - TTg ) ; and Decision 139/2002 / QD - TTg on October 15th 2002 on health examination and treatment for the poor ; Decree 12/2003 / ND - CP on giving birth based on scientific methods .
Especially , gender issue is the first time is mentioned clearly in the Ordinance on Population concretely : forbidding to choose sex of Foetus , regulating the state 's responsibility for promulgation of policies and measures in order to eliminate all forms of discrimination among girls and boys , ensuring the activeness , voluntary , equality for individual , family in birth control and reproductive health .
For the implementation of the above - mentioned regulations , the Ministry of Health has issued documents as technical guidelines on reproductive healthcare , national standards for communal clinics between 2001 and 2010 and for reproductive healthcare in six services ( including maternal safety , family planning , control of infectious reproductive diseases , sexually transmitted diseases , HIV / AIDS infection , juvenile reproductive healthcare , safe abortive measures , counselling ) .
These are important instruments to help healthcare centers improve quality of services and minimize possible incidents that may affect the people 's health , especially women .
In recent years , State budget expenditure for health sector has increased from VND 7,262.4 billion in 2002 to VND 7,751 billion in 2003 ( 4.5 % of the total State budget expenditure ) .
12.2 Structure and organization of healthcare network for women
Prior to May 2003 , the Health Ministry had been reformed in accordance with provisions of Government Decree No 01/1998 / ND - CP dated 3 November 1998 .
The structure and organization of the Ministry of Health continued to be improved in accordance with provisions of Government Decree No 49/2003 / ND - CP dated 15 May 2003 on functions , mandates , powers and organization of the Ministry of Health .
Under this Decree , the Department of Maternal and Child Health Protection and Family Planning was renamed Department of Reproductive Health .
All healthcare centers from central to local levels , both public and non-public , are responsible for providing reproductive healthcare services and implementing the National Standards Guidelines on Reproductive Healthcare Services .
Thanks to this , remarkable improvements have been made in the structure and operational mechanism of these institutions as well as in specialization and qualifications of technical staff , especially at grassroots level .
By the end of 2002 , 100 % of healthcare centers at ward , communal and district levels were provided with medical workers , of which the number communes having doctors increased from 33.86 % in 1999 to 61.5 % in 2002 .
By 31 December 2003 , 93.2 % of ward clinics have midwives and obstetric - pediatric assistant doctors .
The number of medical workers in hamlets increased from 59.41 % in 1999 to 89.8 % in 2002 .
In 61 Centers for Mother and Child Protection and Family Planning , there are 321 obstetric doctors , 60 pediatric doctors , 228 pediatric assistant doctors and 367 midwives .
Given the rapid growth of pharmaceutical retailers , including private stores ( accounting for 72 % of the retail market ) , a supply network was well in place to provide essential medicines to communes and wards in remote and mountainous areas and islands , which meets the WHO 's standards .
These are important conditions to ensure Vietnamese women 's favourable access to and use of high quality healthcare services .
Thanks to the Decision No 139/2002 / QD - TTg of the Prime Minister on purchase of health insurance cards or direct payment for medical examination and treatment with the cost as low as VND 50,000 - 70,000 per person per year , poor women can afford healthcare services .
Annually , about six million women enjoy the benefits of this policy .
Female medical workers account for 62 % of the total number of medical workers ; in all fields of medical examination , treatment , scientific research and education , women make up the majority ; the incumbent Health Minister is also a woman .
However , the proportion of female managers in the health sector remains modest , which is 14.4 % at department , institute and hospital levels , and 17.6 % at provincial levels .
Aware of the important role of women in the cause of people 's healthcare , the Action Plan for the Advancement of Women until 2005 of the health sector has set out the target of raising the proportion of female managers in the health service to 30 - 35 % by 2005 .
Female healthcare and family planning services :
Viet Nam 's female healthcare in general and reproductive healthcare in particular has recorded remarkable progress compared to the year 2000 .
Over the past three years , average life expectancy saw significant increase , which is 71 years old in 2002 , the breakdown of which is 73 for women and 70 for men .
The overall birth rate dropped from 2.28 % in 2000 , 2.25 % in 2001 , and 2.28 % in 2002 , to 2.13 % in 2003 .
Thanks to strong political commitments together with a nation - wide healthcare network , maternal and child mortality rate has been reduced significantly in Viet Nam .
In 2002 , female child mortality rate under five years old was 31.4 %o and male child mortality rate was 34.2 %o.
In 2003 , maternal mortality rate was 85/100,000 ; child mortality rate under one year old was 21 %o ( 40.2 %o for male and 32.9 %o for female ) .
These figures are better than those of other countries at the same level of income per capita .
According to statistics released by the Ministry of Health in 2003 , 5.7 millions badges of people experienced gynaecological check - ups .
Pregnancy check - ups increased by 2.5 times in average ; 95.8 % of women were taken good care of by medical workers in their delivery ; 91 % of pregnant women were injected tetanus vaccine more than twice , or 2.5 times per pregnant woman .
In 2003 , thanks to more effective contraceptive measures , the number of abortions reduced by 19.84 % to 174,505 in comparison with that of the year 2000 .
Intensive communication campaigns and availability of modern family planning measures gave women more and better choices for the most suitable contraceptive measures .
Access to contraceptive measures increased from 71.9 % in 1999 to 76.9 % in 2002 ( Table 5.3 of the Annex ) .
This is indicative of the implementation of the Population Strategy for 2001 - 2010 and Safe Motherhood Programme for 2003 - 2010 as well as other effective measures like marketing of condoms .
However , men 's participation in family planning remains limited and the burden is carried mainly by women , which is reflected in the structure of contraceptive measures : 57 % using Intra uterine devices , 11.4 % using oral contraceptive pills , 7.5 % using condoms , only 0.5 % using male sterilization ( 2003 figures ) .
This is due to a number of reasons , including lack of man 's awareness , ineffective communication campaigns , barriers of old customs as well as low quality and accessibility of services .
With a significant improvement in the people 's life over the past years and the implementation of Ordinance on the Elderly , healthcare services for old women have been upgraded .
The Elderly can enjoy preferential services , such as check - ups and treatment at medical centers and provision of free health insurance for people over 90 years old in accordance with Decree 120/2003 / CP of the Government .
Nutrition
With a view to realizing the targets set in the National Strategy on Nutrition for 2001 - 2010 , Viet Nam has taken active steps to launch various measures on malnutrition prevention , particularly for pregnant women and children under five .
Family 's nutrition model of “ green colour of vegetable , yellow colour of papaya fruits and red colour of egg yolk ” has been scaled up to help families resolve the issue of nutrition through proper diet .
Calories consumption per capita in 2000 reached 1,931 Kcal / day on average .
As a result , the number of pregnant women suffered from anaemia reduced from 52 % in 1995 to 32 % in 2000 .
To realize the targets of National Strategy on Nutrition , the Ministry of Health issued “ 10 Nutritious Advices ” , which is widely responded across the country .
They organized on an annual basis competitions on the occasion of “ Micronutrient Day on 1 - 2 June ” to monitor the health of newborn babies and provide sufficient vitamins for children and iron pills for pregnant women , 15 - year - old girls and post-natal women .
Especially , the “ 10 Nutritious Advices ” have been translated into poems and songs to make them easily understood , remembered and implemented .
However , the number of women suffering from anaemia and asthenia are still larger than men .
Prevention of sexually transmitted diseases ( including HIV / AIDS )
Sexually transmitted diseases have been reduced but at a negligible and unsustainable pace from 199,188 cases in 1998 to 180,125 in 2002 .
The quality in healthcare services remains poor , and access to them was difficult for women , especially in the mountainous and rural areas .
The spread of HIV / AIDS continues to increase , especially in drug addicts using injection .
The number of HIV / AIDS infected picked up from 11,201 in 2000 to 76,180 in December 2003 , of which women account for 13.98 % .
According to 2000 's figures , 60 % of the HIV infected cases were caused by drugs injection , 6.03 % by sexual transmission , and 4 % by prostitution .
The number of infected women in pre-maternal stage increased from 0.2 % in 2000 to 0.34 % and 0.39 % in 2001 and 2002 respectively .
Especially , the number of mother - to - child transmission of HIV increased from 67 cases in 2000 to 83 in 2001 .
The Government has been implementing the National Strategy on the Prevention of HIV / AIDS to 2010 and vision 2020 to reduce the number of newly infected people and provide treatment for those infected .
The Health , Population , Family Planning and Children services in coordination with the Vietnamese Women 's Union , Central Committee of Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth League , competent agencies and mass organizations from Central to local levels have been effectively implementing targets , measures and solutions on people 's healthcare and protection focusing on reproductive healthcare , child mal-nutrition prevention , sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS prevention .
Campaigns on gender and safe sex education have been further promoted , especially for adults and young people .
The Ministry of Health coordinates with competent agencies to carry out the National Strategy on Prevention of HIV / AIDS to 2010 and vision 2020 , and will submit the project on the increased socialization of people 's healthcare to Prime Minister for approval .

Guarantee of women 's right to social and family benefits
Viet Nam 's social welfare policy does not contains any discrimination in terms of sex , social strata and beliefs and gives priority to ethnic minority people and those entitled to preferential social policies .
Thanks to the implementation of the Law on Marriage and Family issued in 2000 and general socio- economic progress of the country over the past three years , women 's benefits from family welfares mentioned in the previous report were maintained and improved .
During this period , the Vietnamese State places great premium on development of social welfare policy , especially for rural and remote areas .
These policies are implemented through a number of programmes and projects on socio-economic development , poverty reduction and employment as well as through international development and humanitarian programmes .
This helps improve women 's life in rural areas .
70 % of women now have access to public utilities like lighting , roads , post offices , cultural services , clinics , and schools .
Guarantee of women 's rights to bank loans , mortgages and other forms of credits :
The revised policies in this field have created more favourable conditions for women to participate in and get access to financial resources .
More women have taken part in credit programmes for poor households .
According to the Bank of Social Policy , by December 2002 , woman - headed poor households accessing to credit loan accounted for 60 % ( increased by 20 % as compared to the third and fourth reports ) .
The ratio of poor households accessing credit loans is relatively high , especially in the Northern mountainous areas ( such as Tuyen Quang , Thai Nguyen , Hoa Binh and Ha Giang ) .
The Government has made several changes in its policy to facilitate people 's higher investment .
Especially , the Bank has increased the credit ceiling from VND 3 million to VND 7 million and extended maturity period from 30 months to 60 months .
In 2000 , the Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development signed with the Vietnamese Women 's Union a joint Resolution on Granting Loans for Women .
After three years of implementation , by 30 June 2003 , 57 out of 90 branches of the bank had provided credit loans to 1.3 million women with the total value of VND 5,134 billion .
This is an exemplary model given the low level of overdue debts and effective use of borrowed loans by women , which also helps socialize bank credits .
The two agencies have reviewed and drawn lessons to further implement the Resolution in coming years .
However , there are existing difficulties facing women when borrowing loans namely limited understanding and inadequate management skills and lack of capacity in formulating effective business and production plans .
The right to participate in recreational , sports and cultural activities :
The Ordinance on Sport and Physical Activities provides State 's policy to encourage the entire population to take part in sport and physical activities of various kinds .
In addition , women can participate in sport and physical activities jointly organized by the Vietnamese Women Union and Committee for Sports and Physical Activities .
According to the report of the Committee , the programme has involved tens of thousands of women in popular sport activities .
In 2003 , the Vietnamese Women 's Union launched a campaign “ Each member chooses one suitable sport for daily exercise . ” The two agencies organized a meeting with female athletes who established high records at the 21st Southeast Asian Games ( SEAGAMES ) and presented gifts to the outstanding athletes selected by Vietnam 's Sports Newspaper in 2001 .
A friendly competition for women in marathon , volleyball , table - tennis , and badminton was organised .
About 1,000 sport and physical training clubs were established , including Tanjiquan clubs , health improvement clubs , and aerobic clubs .
As a result , at the 21st and 22nd SEAGAMES held in 2001 and 2003 , the number of female athletes winning medals accounted for over 60 % .
Thanks to the continued socialization of sport and cultural activities in line with Decree 73/1999/ ND- CP of the Government , the sport and cultural movement has been growing strongly throughout the country , involving people from all social strata , including women .
80 % of districts have allocated lands for cultural , sport , and entertainment activities .
Between 2000 - 2002 , in response to the National Sport Festival , 85 % of communes and districts organised Festivals with the participation of 640,000 people with a large proportion of women .
In the cultural area , encouraging results have been recorded in the realization of “ All people strive to follow a cultural lifestyle ” campaign , which help more people have access to mass media .
According to statistics of the Ministry of Planning and Investment in 2003 , 93 % of households have access to the Voice of Viet Nam ; 86 % can watch programmes broadcasted by Vietnam Television ; television and radio coverage reached 90 % and 92 % respectively nationwide .
Important improvement in women 's spiritual life is attributable to the implementation of the policy of cultural socialization .
Cultural activities have become increasingly rich and imbued with national identity .
The State paid great attention to improving spiritual life of the ethnic minority people through implementing various programmes to support and build cultural houses for people 's social activities .
Many local radio and television stations broadcast programmes in both Vietnamese and other ethnic languages .
Only small number of women living in remote and thinly populated areas has not been able to enjoy cultural , art , radio and television programmes .
To achieve these encouraging outcomes , the State budget allocated to cultural and information field has been increased on a year - on - year basis ( VND 820 billion in 2001 , VND 996 billion in 2002 , and VND 1,302.7 billion in 2003 ) .
Women have also made active contributions to cultural and information sphere , for which they were acknowledged and presented noble titles by the State .
By 2002 , 35 out of 152 people 's artists are women ( 23 % ) ; 459 out of 1245 distinguished artists are women ( 36.86 % ) ; 3 out of 137 people 's teachers are women ( 2.18 % ) ; 42 out of 109 people 's doctors are women ( 12.8 % ) ; 470 out of 2467 distinguished doctors are women ( 18.56 % ) ; 26 individuals and 10 female teams were awarded Kovalevskaya prize .
The State has acknowledged their contribution and conferred the titles of heroic women and woman of the emulation movement in the Doi Moi time ( time of reform ) for 19 and 272 individuals respectively .
A Vietnamese woman received one prize for business in the Vote for Impressive Asian Women 2002 .
The role and position of the Vietnamese women have been enhanced both domestically and internationally .
As compared to the previous report , women 's benefits from sport , cultural and social activities have been raised and people 's life , including that of women , improved .
However , due to financial constraints and lingering gender bias , women 's participation and enjoyment in sport , cultural and social activities still fall below that of men as well as of their own need .
To improve this , competent agencies will continue to elaborate more effective measures to ensure women 's full access to the above - mentioned benefits .
Cultural and sport socialization will be further promoted to create favourable conditions and more opportunities for the people , particularly women , to participate in these activities .
Article 14 Women in rural areas
Social equity is a consistent policy pursued by the State and Government of Vietnam , which serves a prerequisite for women in rural areas to fully participate in and benefit equally from socio-economic achievements in rural areas .
Women in rural areas - the role and challenges
Agriculture plays an important role in the national economy .
In 2003 , agriculture accounts for 21.8 % of GDP , which involved 75 % of the rural population .
In 2002 , women in rural areas accounted for 50.8 % of the population and around 49 % of rural workforce .
The ratio of women in rural areas participating in economic activities was 71 % while that of urban areas was 56 % .
Women in rural areas take part in almost all stages of agricultural production since they constitute 70 - 80 % of the workforce .
In some stages , they are the major workforce , such as seedling , cultivating , harvesting and livestock .
Women also take up 60 - 70 % of the workforce in such crafts as knitting of bamboo and rattan , embroidery , fabric weaving , mat making and food processing .
In the last three years , many policies on agriculture and rural development have been promulgated , namely Decision 132/2000 / QD - TTg by the Prime Minister dated November 24 , 2000 on some incentives for the development of off - farm industries in rural areas , Decision 132/2001 / QD - TTg dated September 7 , 2001 on financial arrangements for implementation of programmes for rural infrastructure development , infrastructure for aquaculture farming and infrastructure of craft villages .
Particularly , with a view to improving gender equality and position of women in rural areas , the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development ( MARD ) adopted a Gender Strategy in Agriculture and Rural Development to 2010 and Gender Plan of Action in Agriculture and Rural Development to 2005 .
The Strategy aims at coordinating and promoting efforts of agencies at all levels , mass organizations and individuals to realize gender equality in agriculture and rural areas where most poor and needy people live and make up the majority of the workforce .
This is also a prioritized area of the National Strategy for the Advancement of Women .
In recent years , the Vietnamese Government attaches great importance to agricultural and rural development .
Therefore , in the 2000 - 2003 period , despite falling prices of agricultural products in the world market , Vietnam 's agriculture enjoyed continuous growth at 4 % per annum .
This serves as a condition to improve the living standards of a large part of farmers , including women .
However , disadvantages and challenges facing women in rural areas as pointed out in the previous report remain unsolved in the main .
Due to accelerating industrialization and urbanization , agricultural land is shrinking .
More and more farmers , mostly men , go to cities to find a job .
They only come back home at the farming season .
As a result , the workload is mainly shouldered by women .
Working hours of those in the working age has increased , reaching 77.65 % in 2003 ; the women 's rate was 77.36 % .
A woman on average spent 13.6 hours per week in 2002 on domestic and unpaid work .
On the other hand , female farmers usually gain lower income than men , equivalent to only 73 % in 2002 .
Female farmers in the mountainous and remote areas , especially single , household - headed and old women , are the most vulnerable group .
More importantly , ethnic minority women suffer from more disadvantages than men since they have limited power in decision making , low level of education and thus , having fewer chances .
Women 's role in formulating and implementing development plans and community activities
Thanks to the policy to maximize the ownership of the people in accordance with the formula " Party 's leadership , State 's management and people 's ownership " . Women are given more favourable conditions to participate in the management of the State and the community .
The review of 5 years implementing the Grassroots Democracy Regulation showed that the motto , " people know , people discuss , people do and people monitor " had been observed in all communes and wards nationwide .
The Women 's Union , in particular , issued guidelines to its local organizations to increase women 's participation in such activities as meetings and discussions about policy on and contribution to building of infrastructure and public utilities , cultural regulations , or measures to counter social evils in the area etc .
The issuance of Decree 79/2003/ ND- CP by the Government on Regulations to exercise democracy at communal level ( replacing the above - mentioned Regulation ) offers women more chances to discuss , make decision , implement and supervise development plans at grassroots level .
Besides , women can raise their voice via women union 's branches to local administrations in accordance with Decision No 163 / HDBT in 1988 by the Ministers ' Council , now Decree No 19/2003/ ND- CP by the Government , ( see Art.
Healthcare and family planning
As stated in Article 12 , women in rural areas enjoy better healthcare thanks to policies to improve grassroots healthcare .
The State applied a voluntary insurance policy to farmers with the premium decided by Provincial People 's Committee .
Apart from that , healthcare system in the mountainous areas and for ethnic minority people has been improved , which enabled ethnic minority women to have better access to healthcare and family planning services .
In 2002 , 100 % of mountainous communes had clinics , of which 83.24 % was concretized , 69 % had medical equipment , and 80 % had electricity and water supply .
100 % of districts had a medical center .
The number of medical staff increased significantly , including larger number of doctors and medical workers at villages and hamlets , basically meeting the demands for medical check and treatment of the people .
In 2002 , 81.02 % of women in rural areas received assistance from medical workers during child delivery ( 97.27 % in the urban areas ) and 70.79 % of pregnant women received maternal check ( 95.78 % in the urban areas ) .
The quality of medical examination and treatment was raised , serious diseases such as goiter and malaria kept under control .
Due attention was paid to information outreach on gynecological diseases for women , hygiene for girls and reproductive healthcare , such as clean delivery and scientific child raising ) .
This reflects enormous efforts by the State in providing medical services for ethnic minority people in general and ethnic minority women in particular .
However , health asthenia in a proportion of women in rural areas still remains .
Facilities in rural clinics are poor , which can not fully meet the demands for healthcare of women .
Poor girls and women still could not afford medicines .
Education and training , agricultural extension
As stated in Article 10 , the Vietnamese laws and policies do not have for any discrimination between rural and urban areas in terms of access to education .
However , it is a reality in rural areas that when families run into financial problems , girls , rather than boys , has to drop out from school for work .
Statistics of universities , colleges and vocational training centers on agriculture and forestry administered by MARD showed that the rates of schoolgirls passing the entrance examinations in 2002 - 2003 were 27.58 % for universities , 52.66 % for colleges , 52.89 % for high schools and 27.9 % for vocational centers .
In 2002 , the rates of female enrolments varied at different levels of education : 18.70 % for PhD ; 57.4 % for post graduation ; 11.8 % for under - graduation ; 40.8 % for secondary and 13.4 % for vocational training .
More and more women in rural areas participate in agricultural extension .
With their hard - work and engagement in all stages of agricultural production , women have been applying science and technology in a rather effective manner .
According to a survey in 2003 by Vietnam Women 's Union , 2,796,685 women across the country participated in the instruction , spread and transfer of modern technologies and techniques .
Social insurance
As stated in the previous report , the voluntary social insurance has been applied on pilot basis in a number of localities .
However , due to low level of development in rural areas , practical measures have been taken by relevant agencies to ensure the effectiveness of this policy .
According to a survey of the Ministry of Labour , War Invalids and Social Affairs , 90 % of the workforce expressed their wish to buy voluntary retirement insurance while only 10 % could afford it and only 10 % wished to seek child - birth insurance since people , including women in rural areas , have very low incomes
Rural women 's access to credits
Given the need for agriculture and rural craft development , there is an increasing need for credits , technical advances and market information .
Decree 78/2002/ND-CP by the Government on credits for the poor and other policy - entitlement groups stipulates that for a less than VND 10 million loan , the borrower needs only an application form and land use right certificate without collateral .
Credit organizations could even provide loans for poor households and individuals under the credit guarantee of the Women 's Union or the Farmers ' Association .
At present , women could get a loan for their business from the Women Union 's Fund , Women 's Saving Credit Group , " Saving Day for Poor Women " funds , and preferential loans for poor households , Poverty Reduction Fund , Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development , Bank for Social Policy etc.
According to statistics by Vietnam Women Union , in 2003 , 3.55 million women nationwide had access to credits from these sources .
Among them , 1.04 million were poor , 29 % of whom were household - headed women .
Most of these credits were provided for women in the rural areas .
Land use right for women in rural areas
The Constitution , Land Law and Law on Marriage and Family provide for equal rights of men and women over land ( See Article 15 ) .
Decree 70/2001/ND-CP by the Government states that households who already received land use right certificate with only the name of the head of the household could request a new certificate with the names of both husband and wife .
In fact , women remain passive and have few opportunities in land allocation due to their lack of understanding of rights and responsibilities over land .
On the other hand , it is an old custom in the rural areas of Vietnam that the husband is usually head of household .
Therefore , both land use right certificate and the local land administration book only have the name of household 's head .
That fact causes troubles for women when they need the land use right certificate as collateral for loans ; in case of land use right division at divorce or at marriage or in case of inheritance following the death of the husband .
By the end of 2002 , agricultural land had been allotted to approximately 12 million farmer households and 91.74 % of the households were granted with agricultural land use certificates , taking up 87.02 % of the agricultural land area .
Only 10 - 12 % of these certificates were registered in women 's names because these heads of households are single women or widows .
Infrastructure , sanitation and environment in rural areas
The Vietnamese Government attaches great importance to rural infrastructure , which is seen as a decisive factor for socio-economic development and poverty reduction in rural areas .
The building of electricity grids , roads , schools and clinics were financed by various sources , mostly Government budget .
By June 2003 , 100 % of districts and 80 % of communes had been connected to the National Electricity Grid .
The Asia Development Bank ( ADB ) and French Development Agency ( FDA ) financed projects in 23 poor provinces for 2003 and 2004 to expand the areas of irrigated land to 47,000 hectares , upgrade 1,980 kilometers of rural roads , provide tap water for 1,063,000 people , build 3,000 rural markets ( the current figure is around 5000 ) , with focus on border markets , fish markets , vegetable markets and floating markets in the Mekong Delta .
Trading centers are opened in the areas with strong production of goods to help women in rural areas to trade agricultural products and increase their incomes .
With regard to clean water and rural environment , an outstanding success is the National Indicative Programme on Clean Water and Sanitation of rural areas in the periods of 1998 - 2000 and 2001 - 2005 .
The Programme aimed at improving the health of the people , especially women and children by reducing infections caused by unsafe water and sanitary conditions , raising living standards , building infrastructure and narrowing the gap between rural and urban areas .
By 2002 , more than 1.7 million sanitary projects were built across the country , including 1.2 million standard latrines and 516,600 husbandry waste treatment structures .
By the end of 2003 , 41 % of the households nationwide had access to rural sanitary utilities , an increase of 10 % compared to 1998 .
55 % of the rural population had access to clean water while in 1998 , the figure was 32 % .
By the end of 2003 , the Programme completed the formulation of planning for provision of clean water and rural sanitation for 7 regions and provinces 61 and cities .
As for post and telecommunications : By April 2003 , 6,755 communal cultural and post points had been set up , among which 6,014 were in operation .
However , in 2,362 communes in special difficulty , only 1,089 communes or 46.1 % so far have had their own post-offices .
VNPT has been implementing a programme to assist these communes .
Future directions
Despite the above - mentioned opportunities , women in rural areas in Vietnam face more disadvantages than men .
Main reasons are inequality in approaching and utilizing resources in agricultural production and a lack of gender sensitivity in the provision of agricultural services .
To fix this problem , Ministries , agencies and localities are required to make greater efforts to implement the National Strategy for the Advancement of Women to 2010 with due attention paid to rural areas , mountainous and ethnic minority people 's areas and islands .
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development ( MARD ) will continue with its Gender Strategy and Gender Action Plan .
To realize gender equality and equally distribute socio-economic benefits to men and women , MARD 's Gender Strategy and Action Plan set the goals of raising gender awareness and responsibility , improving women 's access to and ownership over resources such as land , credits , water , infrastructure and public services , education and information , mainstreaming gender indicators in policies , programmes and projects implemented by MARD , increasing women 's participation in agriculture and rural development , and raising the number of women leading positions and strengthening the machinery for the advancement of women .
With a view to creating jobs , raising income and shifting the economic structure towards agricultural and rural industrialization . The Government will consider issuing a Decree on Encouraging the Development of Rural Industries .
Besides , at the proposal of MARD and MPT ( Ministry of Post and Telematics ) , the Prime Minister is considering approving a credit modality for effective implementation of the National Strategy on Clean Water and Sanitation of Rural Environment to 2020 and a Programme on application and transfer of scientific and technological advances for socio-economic development in rural and mountainous areas for a better life of the people , including that of women .
The National Commission on Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Affairs is now working on a Draft Law on Nationalities to be submitted to the National Assembly with a view to further improving socio - economic conditions of the ethnic minority people .
Article 15 Women 's equal rights before the law and in civil transactions
Since the endorsement of the combined 3rd and 4th Report on Vietnam 's Implementation of CEDAW Convention in 2000 , the principle of non-discrimination against women has been observed in all areas .
Its importance has also been highlighted in the society .
Women enjoy their equal rights with men before the law , independent participation in civil transactions and contract relations , management of assets , freedom to choose their place of residence and participation in legal proceedings to protect their own interests before law enforcement agencies .
Women have the same legal status as men in civil relations
As stated in the previous report , Vietnam 's laws provide for the guarantee of the same legal status of women as men and equal opportunities for them to exercise their rights , which is reflected in the increasing participation of women in civil relations .
Women have the right to practice their professions as men .
The proportion of working women has been on an increase ( see Article 11 ) .
In the judiciary branch alone , the ratio of female judges at the People 's Supreme Court is 22 % , provincial courts 27 % , district courts 35 % .
By the end of the 1st quarter of 2003 , female lawyers across the country took up 20 % of the total .
12.75 % of law firms and offices were run by women .
By law , there is no discrimination between male and female lawyers before the court .
Freedoms to do business without discrimination between men and women continue to be recognized and exercised .
These regulations have created a liberal and flexible framework that facilitates business activities conducted by women and enhances their position in the society .
According to a report by the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry , 4 years after the introduction of the Enterprise Law , 27 % of those registering their business were women and 40 % of household businesses were run by women .
In 2003 , female workers made up a large proportion of the workforce , i.e. 42 % in State owned enterprises , 39 % in the private sector and 65 % in foreign - owned enterprises .
The ratio of businesswomen increased significantly from 15 - 17 % in 1990 - 1995 , to 24.74 % in 2001 and 20 % in 2002 .
As for personal rights over property , in accordance with Article 47 of the Civil Code , all individuals regardless of sex enjoy freedom to creations and their intellectual properties are protected by the State .
Articles 780 and 781 of the Civil Code stipulate that all individuals , men and women alike , are entitled to the protection by the State over their industrial properties , including patents , utility solutions , industrial designs , trademarks , appellations of origin and other properties defined by the laws .
The laws protect property owners against any attempts to infringe on these rights .
In 2002 , for instance , among 121 persons granted patents for industrial properties , there were 37 women .
Women 's rights to property ownership include the rights to manage , utilize and make decisions related to their properties .
Existing provisions on this matter in the Constitution and laws continue to be effective .
Women and men are equal in managing , utilizing and making decisions over their properties , which means they can sell , donate , exchange , or invest their properties in business or hand them down for inheritance .
Any acts aiming at restricting the legitimate right to property ownership of an individual , either man or woman , shall be dealt with by laws .
In the case of ethnic minority people in some areas of socio-economic difficulties , the right of the people to property ownership is not fully observed .
Some ethnic groups still follow matriarchal system and women are leaders of the family , thus having the right to decide their family 's properties .
With regard to the right to land allotment and rent , Vietnam 's laws state that every citizen having the need , no matter man or woman , is entitled to land allotment and rent from the State .
Therefore , if women , as individuals , heads of household or business owners , have demands , they could have access to land in the form of allotment or rent from the State .
Women are also equal with men in shifting , transferring , inheriting , renting out , subcontracting and mortgaging land use right .
With regards to households , the head or the one authorized by him or her will represent the household in exercising land use right .
As for names in land - use certificates , the State has concrete measures that ensure both wife and husband has names in land - use certificate .
Circular 1900/2001/TT-TCDC by Department of Land Office guide procedures to offer the right to land - use without any discrimination against sex of land - users .
Under decree 70/2001/ND - CP dated on 3/10/2001 regulating concretely the enforcement of Law on Marriage and Family , local authorities have issued new land - use certificates for every family .
From 18 October , 2001 , wife and husband have the right to put their names in ownership certificates over property which is required for registration .
With regard to old land - use certificates that only put names of the heads of households , local authorities will issue new land - use certificates that bear names of both husband and wife as request The 2003 amended Land Law also provides for that land - use certificate must bear names of both husband and wife if the land - use right is their shared property ( Article 48 ) .
This new provision will make the registration of husband 's and wife 's shared property as stipulated in the Law on Marriage and Family easier and at the same time ensure women 's access to land .
On the women 's rights to enter into contract : the Civil Code continues to provide women 's equal rights to enter into contract .
Civil contracts that women have entered into so far are mainly loan contracts from credit organizations .
According to surveys carried out in some localities , the number of households headed by women who enter into loan contracts accounts for 37 % .
The Government has issued Decree 178/1999/ ND-CP on guarantee for loans from credit organizations .
According this decree , loans from credit organizations for poor women can be guaranteed by the prestigious socio-political organizations of which they are members .
This has enabled women to engage in civil transactions and benefit from economic opportunities .
On the women 's rights of inheritance : under the Civil Code , every individual , regardless of sex , has the rights to make a will to determine their properties ; to leave properties to heirs as well as to inherit a property according to a will or laws .
On the basis of equality in offering other persons properties and inherit properties according to a will or laws , women have full opportunities to exercise their equal rights with men in the field of inheritance .
To ensure equality in exercising women 's rights of inheritance as well as to protect their legitimate rights and interests , women can sue at people 's courts within ten years since the opening of succession .
However , at present , there are still difficulties and shortcomings in inheritance that need to be dealt with .
Some prolonged disputes on inheritance especially of land - use rights have made women hesitant to take part in court proceedings .
Besides , there is a relatively popular practice in Viet Nam that among people in rural areas or ethnic people , when their daughters get married , in most of the cases , daughters can not inherit properties of their parents .
For women , because they often resign themselves to their fates , they do not claim their rights to inheritance .
This is a backward custom that results in inequality in exercising women 's rights of inheritance that requires efforts by relevant agencies to encourage people to abolish .
To ensure women 's equal rights in civil transactions , article 12 of the Civil Code stipulates that in case their legitimate rights and interests are violated , citizens have the right to request the court or other competent authorities to intervene .
The Civil Code also provides that a civil transaction will be considered invalid if one contracting party use gender difference as an excuse to force women to sign contract or participate in civil transactions , or taking advantage of women 's difficulties to force them enter into civil transactions .
Furthermore , to ensure equality for women in proceedings , Article 8 of the Law on Organization of People 's Courts stipulates that the court proceeds according to the principle that every citizen is equal before law regardless of sex , nationality and religion .
The 1989 Ordinance on Proceedings of Administrative Cases also stipulates that every citizen regardless of sex , has the rights to sue in administrative cases in accordance with laws to request the People 's Court to protect their legitimate rights and interests ( Article 1 ) and every person has equal rights and responsibilities in civil proceedings ( Article 4 ) .
Similarly , the 1994 Ordinance on Proceedings of Economic Cases stipulates that every individual , men or women , legal entity has the rights to file economic cases in accordance with laws to ask the court to protect their legitimate rights and interests ( Article 1 ) and every person has equal rights and responsibilities in the proceedings ( Article 6 ) .
15.2 Women 's rights to freedom of movement and residence of choice :
In addition to provisions of the Constitution ( Article 68 , 73 ) and of the Civil Code ( Article 42 ) mentioned in the previous report , a number of other laws also have provisions and sanctions to ensure these rights .
For example , article 20 of the Marriage and Family Law indicates that , “ The domicile of husband and wife is selected by themselves without being bound by customs , practices and / or administrative boundaries . ” The Penal Code provides that , “ Those who conduct illegal searches of other persons ' places of residence , illegal expel other persons from their residence places or commit other illegal acts infringing upon citizens ' inviolable rights relating to places of residence shall be subject to warning , non-custodial reform for up to one year or a prison term between three months and one year . ” Article 275 of the same Code also stipulates that , “ Those who organize and / or coerce other persons to flee abroad or stay abroad … shall be sentenced to between two years and seven years of imprisonment .
If the offence is committed more than once or causes serious or very serious consequences , the offenders shall be sentenced to between five and twelve years of imprisonment .
And if particularly serious consequences are caused , the offenders shall be sentenced to between twelve and twenty years of imprisonment . ” These provisions free women from discrimination in terms of freedom of residence , movement even when married .
The penal sanctions also show the State 's determination in ensuring the rights of men and women to freedom of residence and movement . ( See Figure 1.5 of the Index of Statistics )
However , there remain customs and practices the result in inequality between men and women and thus fail to ensure women 's rights , such as the custom of “ women have to follow their husband ” and “ a young girl has to obey her father , a young married woman has to obey her husband , the widow has to obey her son ” .
The Vietnamese Government has encouraged people to abolish such customs and comply with the laws .
Some complicated administrative procedures such as that on transfer of residence registration from rural to urban areas ( Decree No 51/1997/ND - CP on Residence Registration and Management ) also prevent a number of women from exercising their rights to freedom of residence and choosing residence places .
On the other hand , women of ethnic minorities are not yet fully aware of their rights .
Subjective reasons namely residence situated far from economic and trading centers , poor infrastructure , lack of means of transportation also make it difficult for both women and men to exercise their rights to freedom of movement and to choose residence places for themselves and their families .
To overcome this situation , the Ministry of Public Security has been working on the final draft amendment to Decree No 51/1997/ ND - CP on Residence Registration and Management to submit to the Government .
The Ministry of Justice is in charge of drafting amendments to the Civil Code .
The Ministry of Public Security is in charge of revising the Residence Law .
The Ministry of Construction is in charge of amending the Housing Law and the Ministry of Justice is drafting a Referendum Law .
The drafts will be submitted by the Government to the National Assembly for consideration in the future .
This will contribute to building a more favorable legal framework for people including women to enjoy fully their civil rights and responsibilities .
Article 16 Women 's equal rights in marriage and family relations
Laws on marriage and family
Over the last three years , women 's rights to freedom and equality in marriage and family relations have continued to be exercised and protected by laws .
The 2000 Marriage and Family Law , which has entered into force since 1 January 2001 , has created a strong legal basis to ensure equality between women and men in areas like personal rights , names to be written in property ownership certificates ; division of property when divorced ; alimony ; nurturing children and so on as written in the combined third and fourth report .
The Marriage and Family Law provides for legal norms for the building of “ prosperous , equal , progressive , happy and lasting families ” ( Article 1 ) , and the basic principles of the marriage and family mechanism is “ voluntary , progressive , and monogamous in which husband and wife are equal ” ; marriage between Vietnamese citizens of different nationalities and / or different religions , between religious and non-religious people , and between Vietnamese citizens and foreigners is respected and protected by law ; husband and wife are obliged to implement population and family planning policy ; parents are obliged to bring up children into citizens useful for the society ; discrimination among children is not accepted ; the State and society have the duty to protect women and children , and help mothers well fulfill their lofty motherhood functions ( Article 2 ) .
To ensure the effective implementation of the Marriage and Family Law , the State has issued a number of specific legal documents as follows :
The National Assembly 's Resolution 35/2000/QH10 on 9 June 2000 on the Implementation of the Marriage and Family Law that encourages marriage registration for husband - wife relations established before 30 January 1987 ; this type of relation if established from 3 January 1987 to 1 January 2001 must be registered ; relations established after 1 January 2001 without registration are not recognized by law .
This regulation will ensure women 's rights in marriage and divorce .
In 2001 , the Government issued Decree 70/2001 / ND - CP providing detailed guidelines on the implementation of the Marriage and Family Law , Decree 77/2001/ ND - CP providing detailed guidelines on marriage registration in accordance with Resolution 35 of the National Assembly , Decree 87/2001/ND-CP on handling administrative violations in marriage and family .
On 10 July 2002 , Decree 68/2002/ND-CP was promulgated to guide the implementation of a number of articles of the Marriage and Family Law on marriage and family relations with foreign elements .
Notably , the Government 's Decree 23/2002/ND-CP on the application of the Marriage and Family Law to ethnic minorities provides that backward customs and practices that have bad effects on ethnic women must be eliminated gradually through flexible and strict ways such as encouraging people to eliminate backward customs and practices that fail to ensure the equal rights of husband and wife in marriage and family relations ( Article 10 ) ; encouraging people to get rid of customs and practices that discriminate between son and daughter ( Article 13 ) ; strictly forbidding forced marriage between a widow or widower with another member of the family of the ex-husband or ex-wife without agreement of that person ( Article 6 ) ; strictly prohibiting commercially motivated wedding request and acts that hinder marriage or violate women 's dignity ( Article 9 ) , parents ' discrimination among children ( Article 13 ) , and customs and practices that allow the reclaim property or impose of penalty when divorced .
Marriage and divorce
On marriage : The Marriage and Family Law provides for no exception for marriage between men aged under 20 and women under 18 .
Marriages that contravene this regulation are considered as “ premature marriage ” ( in contravention of the law ) and must be invalidated by Court .
The Penal Code states that for those who organize weddings and register marriages for people under marriage age , imprisonment of two years may be imposed .
In reality , the average marriage age of women for the first time is 22.8 and for men is 26 ( see figure 2.1 , Statistics Annex ) .
Over the last 3 years , most people have strictly complied with regulations and laws on marriage registration procedures .
However , in mountainous and remote areas , due to difficulties in transport , many people can not register marriage as stipulated by law .
On the other hand , in these areas , a large number of backward customs have not been done away with completely .
These include premature marriage , string extension custom of some ethnic groups ( a younger brother who is single or whose wife is dead is entitled to getting married with his sister in law if his older brother dies ( Brau ethnic group 's ) , an brother in law is entitled to marry his wife 's younger sister if his wife is dead ( Ro Mam ethnic group 's ) and so on .
In the coming time , backward customs and practices will be eliminated when Decree 32 comes into force .
On divorce : the Marriage and Family Law ensures the rights to divorce of both men and women .
However , in ethnic minority areas , divorce is usually not handled by law but by customs and practices of ethnic minorities .
The Marriage and Family Law also ensures equality in division of common properties of husband and wife when divorced , especially the division of land - use rights and housing by stipulating that all valuable properties must be registered in the names of husband and wife .
This is an important legal basis for fair judgment by Court on division of properties in divorce cases in recent years .
In 2002 , 60,265 cases on marriage and family were handled , of which 44 % were sued merely by women and 18 % of which were requested by both wife and husband .
Equal rights during marriage
The 2000 Marriage and Family Law continued to state the equal rights between men and women as a fundamental principle of the marriage and family regime in Viet Nam in the Doi Moi reforms by indicating that “ Husband and wife are equal to each other , having equal obligations and rights in all aspects of their family ” ( Article 19 ) .
This means husband and wife have equal rights and responsibility in exercising the role of parenthood , matters related to children and settlement of common property of the family .
The 2003 Ordinance on Population stipulates that each couple and individual have rights to and responsibilities for productive healthcare , application of family planning measures , building small scale family with a few children .
Decree 104/2003/ND-CP provides specific regulations and guidelines to implement provisions on the gender equality of the Ordinance on Population .
According to the Decree forbids any acts that aims to hinder or force people to take family planning measures , acts that threaten , humiliate dignity and do physical harm to those using contraceptive measures and those having only sons or only daughters ( Article 9 ) .
It also prohibits sex selection ( Article 10 ) .
Especially , the Ordinance has one separate article on gender equality .
It covers issues like education , information and communication on gender equality , elimination of all forms of gender discrimination on gender basis ; assistance for women in reproductive healthcare , family planning and equal access to education and training as well as improvement of all - rounded knowledge and participation into social activities ; men 's responsibility in family planning ; elimination of all forms of discrimination against child girls ; protection of legitimate rights and interests of child girls in daily activities , medical examination and treatment , learning , recreation and comprehensive development .
These regulations are of practical significance in the current circumstances in Viet Nam due to a fact that a proportion of the population still has preference for men to women , which put women under pressure that they must have at least a son to please the husband 's family .
Domestic violence against women
Domestic violence still exists and can be seen mostly in rural areas where people 's mindsets are old - fashioned and women are not fully aware of their rights and interests .
According to a recent research , 80 % of women asked tell that they have suffered some types of domestic violence and more than 15 % have been beaten by their husbands .
The basic causes for domestic violence against women are the fact that women are still looked down in the society and economic difficulties often lead to disagreement between husband and wife .
Though having been informed about their rights and interests , a proportion of women , especially those who living in remote areas have not been fully aware of their legitimate rights and interests .
In additional are impacts of the social evils like alcoholism , gambling , prostitution , drug , extra marital affairs as well as mentality that women when getting married must give birth to a son to maintain the continuity of the family line and disagreement between mothers - in - law and daughters - in - law .
Relevant agencies , especially Women Unions at different levels have worked out various means and ways to prevent domestic violence against women and to help the victims .
The National Target Program on Hunger Eradication and Poverty Reduction has helped improve living conditions of many households .
Remarkably , Women Unions at different levels have been active in disseminating legal knowledge for women and organizing campaigns to raise public awareness on gender equality .
They have also increased reconciliation efforts and proposed to local governments to strict punishment towards those who mistreat women .
In the future , to ensure women 's equal rights in marriage and family , relevant agencies will continue to work with mass organizations and the public to strengthen law enforcement and oversight and strictly deal with acts that violate legitimate rights and interests of women .
At present , the National Committee on Population , Family and Children is finalizing the Viet Nam Family Strategy to 2010 to submit to the Government for approval .
The Ministry of Justice is preparing to submit to the Government the amendment to Decree 68/2002/ ND- CP on the implementation of some articles of the Marriage and Family Law on marriage and family relations with foreign elements .
Conclusion
In the 2000 - 2003 period , Viet Nam has made a step forward in implementing provisions of the Convention as committed at the 25th session of the CEDAW Committee when the Vietnamese delegation presented the second , third and fourth reports .
The achievements attain then have been built on and furthered .
Since 2000 till now , Viet Nam has made new progress , especially in the following areas :
- Women 's rights to freedom and equality have been further ensured .
Women have been given more favorable conditions and opportunities to contribute actively to the national political and economic , cultural and social development .
The role and position of women in the family and community have been enhanced .
- Education and training , healthcare and living standards of women and child girls have been remarkably improved .
Viet Nam has basically acquired gender equality in primary education and is trying to accomplish universalization of lower secondary education .
Healthcare indicators are higher income per capita .
- The State of Viet Nam has taken proactive measures to address gender inequality in some fields especially in access to land and social welfare , enabling women to have their names registered together with their husbands in the land - use right and house ownership certificates and to enjoy social insurance as men do .
- Viet Nam is among the best performers in Southeast Asia-Pacific region in terms of Gender Development Index ( GDI ) .
One of the important factors behind Viet Nam 's success as mentioned above are the achievements recorded in the Doi Moi reform process aiming at ` sustainable economic development in parallel with poverty reduction and addressing social issues '.
The biggest lesson drawn from the last three years is the cooperation the shared responsibility among various authorities , institutions working for women 's advancement and Viet Nam Women 's Union on the basis of the State 's strong political will and efforts of the people to address inequality and improve women 's rights .
Viet Nam 's consistent policy on gender equality and for women 's advancement has once again been demonstrated by the announced National Strategy for Advancement of Vietnamese Women to 2010 .
We are fully aware that numerous difficulties and challenges are still facing Vietnam on its way to eliminating discrimination against women , but the State and entire people of Vietnam are determined to fulfill all its commitments under CEDAW .

Working Group on Minorities
Eleventh session

( Kandy , Sri Lanka , 21 - 24 November 2004 )
Chairpersons - Rapporteurs : Ms. Asma Jahangir , Mr. M.C.M.
Iqbal and Mr. Soli Sorabjee
GE.05-14315 Introduction
The proposal to hold sub-regional seminars has been made by the Working Group on Minorities and endorsed in resolutions of the Sub - Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights .
The purpose of these activities is to raise awareness of the United Nations work on minority issues and questions , enhance cooperation with civil society , contribute to the empowerment of minorities in better defending their rights , and promote awareness of minority rights and the need for their implementation .
In the light of the recommendations made by the Working Group and the Sub - Commission , the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ( OHCHR ) organized the first Sub - Regional Seminar on Minority Rights : Cultural Diversity and Development in South East Asia , held in Chiang Mai , Thailand in December 2002 ( see E/CN.4 /Sub.2 / AC.5/2003/2 ) .
The second Sub - Regional Seminar on Minority Rights : Cultural Diversity and Development in Central Asia was organized in Bishkek from 27 to 30 October 2004 ( see E/ CN.4 / Sub.2/2005 / AC.5/2005/5 ) .
The third Sub - Regional Seminar on Minority Rights : Cultural Diversity and Development in South Asia was held in Kandy , Sri Lanka , from 21 to 24 November 2004 .
The present seminar was organized by OHCHR in cooperation with the Working Group on Minorities , with the support of the Human Development Organization , based in Kandy .
The invitation of the Government of Sri Lanka to hold the meeting in Kandy was much appreciated .
The Permanent Missions to the United Nations Office at Geneva of countries in the Asian region were informed about the seminar and invitations made for the representation by Governments .
Minority representatives to this meeting came from different countries in the region and the situation in Bangladesh , India , Nepal , Pakistan and Sri Lanka was considered .
The list of participants is annexed to the present report .
The Seminar was preceded by a one - day training session .
The main themes discussed during the seminar related to the current situation of minorities in South Asia - national legislation and its implementation in practice , participation in public life and peaceful and constructive group accommodation and participation in development .
A summary of the discussions that took place during the seminar is contained in a separate document ( E / CN.4 / Sub.2 /AC.5/2005/WP.6 ) .
A CD - ROM was distributed to the participants , containing inter alia the text of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , United Nations materials relating to minorities , papers presented at the present Seminar , and other papers concerning the subregion submitted to the Working Group .
Conclusions
The participants at the Sub - Regional Seminar on Minority Rights : Cultural Diversity and Development in South Asia , meeting in Kandy , Sri Lanka , from 21 to 24 November 2004 , agreed on the following conclusions and recommendations .
The participants find that the problems of religious minorities , linguistic groups , ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples discussed in the seminar share a number of common elements across the South Asian subregion .
All the countries share a colonial past and the problems of today have historical roots , stemming from the political and social structures introduced by the colonial powers .
After decolonization , ethnic , linguistic , racial , caste - based and religious differences surfaced as the post-colonial States sought to establish their authority and writ over diverse population groups .
It has been observed that in the formative phases of the new States almost all the constitutions were secular in nature .
However , over time , most of these constitutions have been amended to suit the interests of the powerful dominant political elites .
In countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh , military interventions have disfigured the original intent and contents of the constitutions and thwarted the evolution of a secular system .
In other countries — for example India and Sri Lanka — the constitutions may have remained secular in nature but in practice colonial elites took over State apparatuses and entrenched their own power .
In all cases this was done in the name of nation building .
The process led to the marginalization of the minorities in all countries .
Invariably , exclusion became the organizing principle of national polities .
The participants noted that all the national constitutions are riddled with contradictions ( Bhutan does not have a constitution ) .
On the one hand , the constitutions guarantee varying degrees of fundamental human rights and political equality . But on the other , the same constitutions also provide a dominant status for the powerful majority groups .
Administrative practices , electoral processes , distribution of national resources and the organization of political , economic and socio-cultural structures under these constitutions are heavily biased in favour of the dominant classes .
This situation has led to a variety of conflicts in every country .
Many of them have turned violent .
Most of the conflicts and problems involving ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities and indigenous people are little known internationally or even within the region .
Governments have used their monopoly over the media and their diplomatic missions at regional and international forums to hide these issues and to prevent the outside world from knowing the real situation .
States have not fulfilled their responsibilities in giving adequate physical and other protection to minorities , and there has been insufficient pressure on States to fulfil their role as the protector of the rights of persons belonging to minorities .
Where there is a breakdown in measures to protect minority rights , the State should take speedy and expedient measures to prosecute and bring offenders to book .
The duty of the State to protect the minorities is absolute and in cases of infringements , the burden is on the State to explain its failure to fulfil its obligations .
Recommendations
The participants proposed that recommendations for action addressed to various entities , aimed at strengthening the promotion and protection of minorities , be forwarded through appropriate channels for consideration .
Recommendations to Governments
The participants recommend that Governments of the South Asian subregion :
Ratify , if they have not already done so , both international covenants and other conventions and optional protocols pertaining to the rights of vulnerable groups , minorities and indigenous peoples , including ILO Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries , and enact requisite national legislation that is in compliance with such international standards ;
Adopt measures to ensure that secularism and the promotion and preservation of cultural diversity is defended in national legislation , and remove any anomalies in the constitution , other legislation , rules and regulations that provide room for discriminatory policies and practices on the basis of religion , ethnicity , language , caste and race as well as the situation of women ;
Review legislation , in each country of the subregion , to ensure that anti-terrorism or states or emergency legislation respect human rights and fundamental freedoms , and where necessary , reform such legislation , and consider requesting technical assistance from the United Nations in that regard ;
Initiate and effectively implement special measures of protection , including affirmative action programmes , for minorities and other vulnerable groups ;
Take urgent measures to reduce statelessness and address refugee situations , especially those which are long - standing , such as the situation affecting the Bihari people and the Bhutanese refugees in Nepal , and commission independent studies on the impact of the situation of refugees and internally displaced persons , particularly on communities of indigenous peoples ;
Provide adequate and accessible remedies to address violations of the rights of persons belonging to minorities , and establish independent courts and tribunals to deal with such cases .
The composition of tribunals or courts must have adequate representation of the aforesaid groups .
Provisions should be made for adequate access to such courts and tribunals ;
Provide a standing invitation to the special rapporteurs and other United Nations bodies and mechanisms to monitor the situation of minority rights and vulnerable groups ;
Incorporate input from civil society groups and members of minority communities into reports submitted by Governments to international bodies ;
Prosecute , under relevant laws , hate speech and the dissemination of prejudices against minorities in the electronic and printed media ;
Reform the educational curricula to provide human rights education and review educational curricula to ensure that stereotypes and prejudices against minorities , especially religious minorities , and indigenous groups of people are removed from textbooks ;
Ensure that minorities have the right to education in their mother tongue ;
Ensure that persons belonging to minorities are not denied citizenship and take urgent measures to address such situations ;
Introduce governance reforms to bring administrative practices in conformity with international norms , evaluate the situation of minorities in public employment and , where necessary , provide greater opportunities for minorities to gain employment in government service ;
Take stringent and resolute steps to eliminate the menace of corruption , which is a potent source of violation of socio-economic rights , especially of the minorities and indigenous groups ;
Establish mechanisms for the appropriate representation and equal participation of minorities and indigenous peoples , including women belonging to minorities , in decision - making processes
Undertake sensitization programmes on the rights of minorities for both minorities and the majority population and for specific occupational groups such as law enforcement officials ;
Establish independent national human rights institutions where they do not already exist , with representation from all groups of people .
Appointments to these commissions should be made in consultation with independent bodies and in conformity with the Paris Principles .
Where such commissions are already in existence , they should have powers to hold public hearings on minority issues and have the mandate to investigate and grant remedies for the violation of minority rights .
The establishment of special units within the national institutions to monitor the implementation of minority rights as provided under international treaties and conventions should be considered .
Recommendations of these commissions should be implemented .
The staff of such institutions should also be representative of different minorities and population groups ;
Ensure that all peace agreements between conflicting parties within the region are complied with , and provide particular special protection for the rights of minorities , indigenous people and other vulnerable groups , such as children , in areas where there is conflict ;
Ensure that the targets of the Millennium Development Goals are met with respect to whole populations , including minorities and other vulnerable groups .
The participation of minorities in the planning , implementation and evaluation of and reporting on programmes and strategies to achieve the Millennium Development Goals should also be ensured , and that development aid and benefits reach the rightful beneficiaries who are deprived , disadvantaged and living in poverty ;
Recognize and respect the traditional land rights and traditional occupations of indigenous people .
Encroachment on their lands and their displacement from lands should not be resorted to in the name of development projects or perceived security considerations .
Where the rights of people have been violated in the name of development , adequate compensation should be granted by those responsible ;
Consider establishing a mechanism for preventing religious intolerance and for drafting a convention on religious tolerance , especially given the richness of religious diversity in the Asia-Pacific region ;
Consider establishing a regional human rights mechanism ( as they exist in other regions ) and a regional mechanism for the protection of the rights of minorities ( as exists in Europe ) .
United Nations and international and intergovernmental bodies
Participants recommend that the United Nations and international and inter-governmental organizations and bodies :
Urge States to comply with their international obligations and to ratify international human rights instruments and any optional protocols thereto , including the Rome Statute ;
Disseminate information and raise awareness among minority groups about the mechanisms and remedies available in the United Nations system .
Technical training should be provided to non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) concerned with issues relating to minorities , indigenous peoples and internally displaced persons on how to use the United Nations human rights system ;
Urge States to ensure that security and anti-terrorism legislation and its implementation in different countries of the subregion is in conformity with international human rights standards , and offer the provision of technical assistance in that regard ;
Ensure that the United Nations and other international organizations and agencies reach out to disadvantaged minorities and that minorities receive benefits from United Nations and other country development projects ;
Continue to provide forums for minorities to discuss their problems at the regional level and for the further consideration of sub-regional statements of principle ;
Support the establishment of an international year for minorities , to be followed by a decade ;
Urge Member States to adopt , in the General Assembly , the recommendation of the Economic and Social Council to establish a voluntary fund for minorities to facilitate and encourage the participation of minority representatives in minority - related activities , including the Working Group on Minorities ;
Review the action taken in respect of the recommendations and conclusions reached at previous sub-regional seminars and meetings and ascertain whether those recommendations have or have not been implemented , and identify the causes and reasons for their non-implementation ;

Statement by the President of the Security Council
At the 5342nd meeting of the Security Council , held on 21 December 2005 , in connection with the Council 's consideration of the item entitled “ Reports of the Secretary - General on the Sudan ” , the President of the Security Council made the following statement on behalf of the Council :
“ The Security Council welcomes the commencement in Abuja , Nigeria , of the seventh round of the African Union ( AU ) - led inter - Sudanese peace talks on Darfur , and expresses its appreciation to the African Union , the international community and the other donors .
“ The Security Council is encouraged by the active participation of representatives from all invited groups of the Sudan Liberation Movement / Army ( SLM / A ) and the Justice and Equality Movement ( JEM ) , as well as members of the Sudan People 's Liberation Movement , as part of the Government of National Unity , and urge their continued cooperation with the African Union Mission in Sudan ( AMIS ) and with the United Nations Mission in the Sudan ( UNMIS ) .
“ The Security Council calls on all parties to the conflict to fulfil their commitments to conclude a just and full peace accord without further delay .
The Security Council demands that all parties refrain from violence and put an end to atrocities on the ground , especially those committed against civilians , including women and children , humanitarian workers and international peacekeepers .
“ The Security Council recalls the demands on the Government of the Sudan and the rebel forces , as well as other armed groups , to respect fully their commitments referred to in its recent resolutions .
The Council demands , in particular , that the SLM / A , the JEM and the Government of the Sudan immediately cease violence , comply with the N'djamena Ceasefire Agreement , end impediments to the peace process and cooperate fully with the African Union Mission , and that the Government of the Sudan disarm and control militias .
It further demands that those responsible for violations of human rights and international humanitarian law be brought to justice without delay .
“ The Security Council recalls its concern that the persisting violence in Darfur might further negatively affect the region , in particular the security of Chad .
It firmly condemns in this context recent attacks perpetrated by armed elements within Chad and in particular the attack on 19 December 2005 on positions of the Chadian national army in the town of Adré , and supports efforts to reduce tensions on the border .
“ The Council reaffirms its determination to make full use of existing measures under the relevant Security Council resolutions on the Sudan , including holding accountable those responsible for violence and violations of the arms embargo , and those who impede the peace process .
“ The Security Council expresses its gratitude to the African Union and its Mission in Sudan ( AMIS ) for the positive role its forces have played in reducing violence and promoting the restoration of order in Darfur .
“ The Security Council also appeals to donors to continue both supporting the crucial work of AMIS in stemming the violence in this suffering region and providing critical humanitarian assistance to millions of war - afflicted civilians in Darfur and across the border in Chad .
“ In the broader Sudan context , the Security Council welcomes further progress achieved in the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement , in particular the signing of the Constitution for Southern Sudan and the formation of the Government of Southern Sudan ( GOSS ) . ”
The meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.
Agenda item 47 ( continued )
2001-2010 : Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries , Particularly in Africa
Draft resolution ( A/60 / L.44 )
The President : Members will recall that the General Assembly held a debate on agenda item 47 , jointly with agenda item 66 and its sub-items ( a ) and ( b ) , at the thirty - first to thirty - third plenary meetings on 13 and 14 October .
I call on the representative of Rwanda to introduce draft resolution A /60 / L.44 .
Mr. Kamanzi ( Rwanda ) : On behalf of the African Group and all the sponsors , I have the honour to introduce , under agenda item 47 , draft resolution A /60 / L.44 , entitled “ 2001 - 2010 : Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries , Particularly in Africa ” .
I should like to announce that , since the publication of the draft resolution , the following countries have become sponsors : Angola , Brazil , Djibouti , Egypt , Fiji , Finland , Gabon , Ghana , Lesotho , Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , Slovakia , Slovenia , the Solomon Islands , the Syrian Arab Republic and Turkey .
Africa bears an overwhelming proportion of the malaria burden .
The Secretary - General reports that “ [ u ] p to 144 million people in Africa currently live in areas at risk of epidemic malaria ” ( A/60/208 , para .
Epidemic malaria is the cause of up to 12 million malaria episodes and between 155,000 and 310,000 deaths per year among people of all ages in Africa alone .
Malaria is , however , a disease that is preventable , treatable and curable .
It is thus , in the effort to combat malaria as well as to implement the Millennium Development Goals , that the African Group has submitted the draft resolution entitled “ 2001 - 2010 : Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries , Particularly in Africa ” .
The draft resolution is an update of a similar resolution adopted last year on this issue .
The draft resolution has been updated to take into account the new developments and measures to combat malaria .
My delegation wishes to thank the delegation of Tanzania for facilitating the negotiation of the text , and also all Member States that participated in the discussion on the draft resolution .
Their contributions have enriched the draft resolution , the implementation of which will facilitate the eradication of that deadly disease . My delegation , in introducing the draft resolution , hopes that , as in previous years , it will be adopted by consensus .
In operative paragraph 8 , the word “ and ” should appear in the third line between the words “ Malaria ” and “ through country - led initiatives ” , and a comma should be inserted after the words “ adequate international support ” . The revised paragraph would read as follows :
The President : The Assembly will now take a decision on draft resolution A /60 / L.44 , as orally revised .
May I take it that the General Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution A /60 / L.44 , as orally revised ?
Draft resolution A/60 / L.44 , as orally revised , was adopted ( resolution 60/221 ) .
The President : May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item 47 ?
It was so decided .
Agenda item 66 ( continued )
New Partnership for Africa 's Development : progress in implementation and international support
( a ) New Partnership for Africa 's Development : progress in implementation and international support
Draft resolution ( A/60/L.16/Rev.1 )
( b ) Causes of conflict and the promotion of peace and sustainable development in Africa
Draft resolution ( A/59 / L.45 )
The President : Members will recall that the General Assembly held a debate on agenda item 66 and its sub-items ( a ) and ( b ) , jointly with agenda item 47 , at the thirty - first to the thirty - third plenary meetings on 13 and 14 October .
The President : I give the floor to the representative of Jamaica to introduce draft resolutions A/60/ L.16/Rev.1 and A/60 / L.45 .
Mrs. Mills ( Jamaica ) : I have the honour , on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , to introduce two draft resolutions under agenda item 66 , “ New Partnership for Africa 's Development : progress in implementation and international support ” .
I should like to indicate that , since the formal submission of both texts , additional sponsors have signed on to both draft resolutions .
With respect to draft resolution A /60 /L.16/Rev.1 , additional sponsors to those listed in the document are Angola , Austria , Canada , Denmark , Djibouti , Finland , France , Greece , Italy , Japan , Luxembourg , Poland , Portugal , Rwanda , Slovenia , Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland .
With respect to draft resolution A/60/L.45 on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary - General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , additional sponsors to those listed in the document are Angola , Canada and Rwanda .
Both draft resolutions are of particular importance to the Group of 77 and China .
They both reflect the full importance that the Group attaches to extending support to the African continent .
That is in keeping with the special attention that has been given to the special needs of Africa throughout the course of this year .
We continue in both draft resolutions to underscore the progress made in the continent , but reiterate more importantly the need for the continued support of the United Nations system and the wider international community in general .
I should like to indicate some revisions to draft resolution A/60/L.16/Rev.1.
In operative paragraph 15 , we would delete the words “ and of the assessment of the level and extent of aid delivery vis -à - vis pledges ” .
The paragraph would thereby end with the words “ on Africa ” .
With respect to operative paragraph 19 , the word “ continuing ” should be substituted for the word “ continuous ” .
With those revisions , I commit to the General Assembly both draft resolutions for adoption by all member States .
Before concluding , I should like to extend compliments on behalf of the Group of 77 and China to the facilitator , Mr. Abdellah Benmellouk of Morocco , and to all delegations that participated in the negotiations , there by enabling the texts to be brought to the Assembly for adoption by consensus .
The President : The General Assembly will now proceed to consider draft resolutions A /60 / L.16/Rev.1 , as orally revised , and A /60 /L.45 .
In connection with draft resolution A /60 / L.16/Rev.1 , as orally revised , I call on the representative of the Secretariat .
Ms. Kelley : In connection with draft resolution A /60 / L.16/Rev.1 , as orally revised , I wish to inform the General Assembly that , under the terms of the third preambular paragraph of the draft resolution , as orally revised , the General Assembly would recall further “ the 2005 World Summit Outcome , including the recognition of the need to meet the special needs of Africa ” .
In operative paragraph 33 of the draft resolution , the General Assembly would request the Secretary - General
“ to continue to take measures to strengthen the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa in order to enable it to effectively fulfil its mandate , including monitoring and reporting on progress related to meeting the special needs of Africa ” .
Resources to strengthen the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa are included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006 - 2007 , as contained in document A / 60/ 6 ( Sect. 2 ) and in the revised estimates , as contained in document A /60 / 537 , of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006 - 2007 , relating to the outcome document of the High - level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly of September 2005 , submitted by the President of the General Assembly .
Therefore , should the General Assembly adopt draft resolution A/60 / L.16/Rev.1 , as orally revised , no additional appropriations would be required .
The President : The Assembly will now take a decision on draft resolutions A /60 / L.16/Rev.1 , as orally revised , and A /60 /L.45 .
The Assembly will first take a decision on draft resolution A /60 / L.16/Rev.1 , entitled “ New Partnership for Africa 's Development : progress in implementation and international support ” , as orally revised .
Ukraine has become a sponsor of the draft resolution .
May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution A /60 / L.16/Rev.1 , as orally revised ?
Draft resolution A/60/L.16/Rev.1 , as orally revised , was adopted ( resolution 60/222 ) .
The President : The Assembly will now take a decision on draft resolution A /60 / L.45 , entitled “ Implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary - General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa ” .
Ukraine has become a sponsor of the draft resolution .
May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution A /60 / L.45 ?
Draft resolution A/60 /L.45 was adopted ( resolution 60/223 ) .
The President : Before I call on delegations wishing to speak in explanation of position on the draft resolutions just adopted , may I remind them that explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats .
I call on the representative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in explanation of position .
Mrs. Núñez de Odremán ( Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : The delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has not opposed the consensus , given our support for and solidarity with the peoples of Africa .
However , given our well - known position concerning the outcome document of the 2005 summit , we wish to express reservations concerning the third preambular paragraph of resolution 60/222 and the fifth preambular paragraph of resolution 60/223.
The President : May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude its consideration of sub-items ( a ) and ( b ) of agenda item 66 and of agenda item 66 as a whole ?
It was so decided .
The President : The time has come for me to make a few concluding remarks before we close this part of the work of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly .
As I said , I hope that today will be the last day of our work , but since I am not certain of the time of the day when we shall be able to meet again in the plenary to decide the budget , I want to take advantage of the broad presence of representatives in this Hall this morning to say a few words .
I trust that they have all received my letter of yesterday reviewing our progress to date on the 2005 world summit follow - up ; I will not repeat the details of that letter .
It has also been circulated in the Hall today .
As members know , the Fifth Committee has not yet finalized the work on the 2006 - 2007 budget .
I am encouraged by the diligent and constructive efforts that are being made to find solutions , and I am hopeful that during the course of the day we can reach a conclusion on that urgent and absolutely vital issue for the United Nations .
We need clearly defined financial conditions guiding our work in the next two years .
I am the first to acknowledge that this has been an unusually intense period of work for the General Assembly .
Let us recall that , exactly 100 days ago , our leaders gathered here for the world summit and adopted an ambitious reform agenda for the United Nations .
That set the pace and direction of much of our work over the past few months .
Since the summit , we have engaged wholeheartedly in the implementation of the reforms , alongside our regular programme of work .
I am deeply grateful to all representatives for the energy they have invested in our work and for their willingness seriously to work through the open , transparent and inclusive mechanisms we have put in place for our consultations and negotiations .
We have already recorded some important achievements .
We have reached agreement on the Peacebuilding Commission .
We have expanded and transformed the existing central humanitarian funding mechanism into the new Central Emergency Response Fund .
We have adopted the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel , and later today we will , I hope , be able take action on the draft resolution on HIV / AIDS , paving the way for an important high - level meeting next year .
Those are achievements of which we should all be very proud .
If they are quickly and effectively implemented — the word “ implemented ” is important in our Organization — and effectively supported , they stand to make an important , practical difference to people around the world who rely on the United Nations in their hope for a brighter future .
Those achievements are also an early indication to the world that this body , the General Assembly of the United Nations , can and will take difficult but important decisions on the challenges that confront us and the world .
Our achievements so far must also give impetus to our ongoing work on other important reform issues — the Human Rights Council , development follow - up and reform of the Economic and Social Council , Secretariat and management reform , Security Council reform and the work on counter - terrorism .
They should also give us strength as we begin in January to consider further aspects of the summit follow - up , such as system - wide coherence , the environment work and General Assembly revitalization .
I believe , as I stated earlier , that the most valuable and tangible contribution that we can make to revitalizing the General Assembly will be the timely and effective implementation of the world summit outcome .
After this fall 's work and experiences , I am more convinced than ever about the importance of strengthening the role and relevance of the General Assembly .
We represent all the nations and all the peoples of the world .
Together , we must reaffirm the central position of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative , policy - making and representative organ of the United Nations .
Today , I would first like to express my thanks to all the members of the Secretariat , not least Under - Secretary - General Jian Chen and all the dedicated and hard - working staff in the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management .
They have provided us with invaluable support during this first part of the sixtieth session .
Nor must we forget all the people who work behind the scenes — the interpreters , the printers and everyone who makes our work flow so well .
Secondly , I would like to thank our co-chairs , Committee chairs and all the others among us who have played leading roles in our work to date .
Some have just brought their work to a conclusion , others are just beginning , but they are united by their skilled approach and strong commitment to their work and their determination to see the United Nations deliver what our leaders asked us to do .
I would also like to thank all our Permanent Representatives , representatives and staff for the noble spirit in which they have worked and for the support they have given me and my Office during these first 100 days .
It is deeply appreciated .
A particular thanks goes to the excellent group of vice - presidents , who have so skilfully and faithfully helped me lead the General Assembly .
When I was writing these remarks together with my colleagues , we tried to look for other things that had happened in 100 days .
In fact , we found that , in the nineteenth century , there was a Chinese emperor who launched 100 days of reform , during which he initiated many bold and ambitious reform processes .
The only trouble — one which made me hesitant to bring up that example — was that , after 100 days , his aunt , the empress dowager , decided that she had had quite enough and put him in prison for the rest of his life .
In closing , I would like to wish everyone and their families a joyful and peaceful holiday season and a prosperous new year .
I trust that we will all — including our members of the Fifth Committee — have an opportunity to rest and recharge our batteries over the coming days .
I look forward to welcoming everyone back in January to continue our work with renewed energy , determination and belief in this Organization .
The Assembly will take up the remaining items as listed in today 's Journal , including the reports of the Fifth Committee , as soon as the Fifth Committee has finished its work .
The meeting was suspended at 10.55 a.m. and resumed at 10.10 p.m.
The President : I welcome members back this evening ; we at the United Nations have some strange ways of celebrating holidays .
And to extend our pleasure , before we reach the budget issue , at the outcome of which we are rejoicing , we need to go through the other agenda items that we left unfinished this morning .
Agenda item 45
Follow - up to the outcome of the twenty - sixth special session : implementation of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV / AIDS
Draft resolution ( A/60 /L.43 )
Report of the Fifth Committee ( A/60/625 )
The President : The report of the Fifth Committee on the programme budget implications of draft resolution A /60 / L.43 is issued as document A /60 / 625 , and the text of the programme budget implications is contained , for the time being , in document A / C.5/60/L.22 , section J.
In view of the lateness of the hour , I will not read out my prepared statement on this important draft resolution .
Copies are being distributed to delegations .
Let me say only that the new year , 2006 , will mark five years since the landmark Declaration of Commitment on HIV / AIDS , adopted at the twenty - sixth special session of the General Assembly .
The world has made progress on the fight against HIV / AIDS , but much remains to be done .
In the next hour , more than 300 people will die as a result of AIDS .
In the same span of time , more than 500 men , women and children will become newly infected , more than half of them under the age of 24 .
Our initial response to HIV / AIDS was slow , but we must make 2006 the year when the international community finally steps up to the plate .
We need to focus on education , gender and health .
I was glad that the General Assembly 's recent summit outcome document ( resolution 60/ 1 ) included provisions on health systems capacity and that the Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution on enhancing capacity - building in global public health ( resolution 60/35 ) .
The draft resolution I am introducing today , entitled “ Preparations for and organization of the 2006 follow - up meeting on the outcome of the twenty - sixth special session : implementation of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV / AIDS ” , paves the way for the comprehensive review of progress in implementing the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV / AIDS and for the high - level meeting to be held in May and June 2006 .
Further , it responds to the commitment undertaken by our leaders at the 2005 world summit to fully implement all the commitments established by the Declaration .
Let me just extend my sincere thanks to Ambassador Christopher Hackett of Barbados and Ambassador Laxanachantorn Laohaphan of Thailand for their skilled and committed co- chairing of the informal consultations which produced this draft resolution .
And , of course , I want to pay tribute to all delegates for reaching agreement in the consultations .
We all know that there was difficulty finding common ground on some sensitive issues .
That spirit of compromise is much appreciated .
In closing , I should note that high - level attendance will be critical to the success of the proposed meeting next year .
If draft resolution A/60 / L.43 is adopted today , I would strongly encourage high - level representation at the meeting from as many Member States as possible .
Before giving the floor to the representative of Cuba , who wishes to speak in explanation of position on draft resolution A /60 / L.43 , I remind delegations that explanations of vote or position are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats .
Mr. Cumberbach Miguén ( Cuba ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : When the 2005 World Summit Outcome ( resolution 60 / 1 ) was adopted , our delegation clearly indicated its dissatisfaction with the section on various questions related to the international development agenda .
We made clear our reservations with respect to the text of the outcome document , whose adoption was marred by a lack of transparency and by manipulation on the part of certain very powerful delegations .
No substantive progress was made in terms of the commitments undertaken in United Nations summits and conferences .
Nor were we able to reaffirm the outcomes of those summits and conferences .
While the outcome document affirms that the agreed commitments of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV / AIDS of the twenty - sixth special session , held in 2001 , will be fully implemented , it then immediately undermines those agreed commitments : the goal of universal access to treatment for all those who need it is reduced to the mere aim of coming as close as possible to that goal by 2010 .
But we all know that to halt the pandemic , urgent and effective action must be taken now .
It is clear that the guardians of the neo-liberal marketplace are more concerned about the profits of the major pharmaceutical corporations than about the lives of millions of human beings who suffer the consequences of HIV / AIDS .
The families of the some 300 people who will die — as you , Sir , said — in the next hour should be aware of that .
With the adoption of draft resolution A/60 / L.43 , on preparations for the meeting to be held next year , the General Assembly is about to repeat the error it made in September 2005 .
Our delegation will therefore not join the consensus on the draft resolution , and it disassociates itself from the draft resolution 's language on universal access to treatment for all those that need it , contained in paragraph 12 , which repeats the step backwards taken by paragraph 57 ( d ) of the September 2005 summit outcome document .
Furthermore , that language prepares the way for diluting other development goals in public health and other areas that are not of interest to big business .
Our country will continue to oppose the obstacles put in the path of the sustainable development of developing countries .
The President : In view of the lateness of the hour , may I ask delegates to make their explanations of vote or position as brief as possible .
The Assembly will now take a decision on draft resolution A /60 / L.43 , entitled “ Preparations for and organization of the 2006 follow - up meeting on the outcome of the twenty - sixth special session : implementation of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV / AIDS ” .
May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution A /60 / L.43 ?
The draft resolution was adopted ( resolution 60/224 ) .
The President : I call now on delegations wishing to speak in explanation of position on the draft resolution just adopted .
Mr. Yáñez Pilgrim ( Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : Our delegation did not oppose the consensus on A/60 / L.43 , but it believes it necessary to make the following statement .
One of the many reasons for which the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela did not accept the 2005 World Summit Outcome ( resolution 60 / 1 ) was because of the considerable step backwards in the area of the fight against HIV / AIDS that it would legitimize .
The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela sees the new language accepted by some heads of State or Government — by which the commitment is solely to come as close as possible to the goal of universal access to treatment by 2010 for all those who need it rather than a firm commitment to ensure access for all to antiretroviral treatment — as a step backward and a failure to implement the Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals .
We urge the entire international community to keep the Millennium Declaration commitments alive and not limit the goals set in 2000 by means of this new , not very encouraging language .
We also hope that this step backwards in the fight against the scourge of HIV / AIDS does not set a precedent that allows the most powerful countries of the international system to reduce the other Millennium Development Goals to their bare minimum .
For those reasons , we express our reservations with respect to the third preambular paragraph and operative paragraph 12 of the draft resolution .
Mr. Wolff ( United States of America ) : The United States joined consensus on the resolution just adopted on preparations for and organization of the 2006 follow - up meeting on the outcome of the twenty - sixth special session : implementation of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV / AIDS .
While we regret the appearance of an unexpected , last - minute report on programme budget implications , it is our expectation that all costs for the comprehensive review not already covered by the biennium budget will be absorbed .
The President : The General Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item 45 .
Agenda item 73 ( continued )
( a ) Strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations
Draft resolution ( A/60 /L.34 )
Amendment ( A/60 /L.35 )
Report of the Fifth Committee ( A/60/621 )
The President : Members will recall that the Assembly held the debate on agenda item 73 and its sub-items ( a ) , ( c ) and ( d ) at its 51st and 52nd plenary meetings , on 14 November 2005 , and adopted seven resolutions under this item at its 52nd and 63rd plenary meetings .
In connection with this sub-item , the General Assembly now has before it a draft resolution issued as document A /60 / L.34 and an amendment thereto contained in document A /60 / L.35 .
The report of the Fifth Committee on the programme budget implications of draft resolution A/60/L.34 and its amendment is issued as document A /60 / 621 , and the text of the programme budget implications is contained , for the time being , in document A / C.5/60/L.22 , section F.
Before proceeding further , I would like to inform members that the sponsor of the amendment contained in document A /60 / L.35 has withdrawn the amendment .
I give the floor to the representative of the United States , who wishes to speak in explanation of position .
Mr. Wolff ( United States of America ) : The United States is pleased to join the consensus on the draft resolution on assistance to survivors of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda , particularly orphans , widows and victims of sexual violence , with the following explanation .
With respect to operative paragraph 5 , to which we had proposed an amendment , issued as document A /60 / L.35 , we wish to emphasize our commitment to carrying out the mandate of the draft resolution .
We also wish to reaffirm our commitment to stopping genocide wherever it may occur and to supporting outreach programmes for all citizens and countries that have suffered that monstrous crime .
That is why we are joining the consensus on this draft resolution .
We have devoted substantial monetary and human resources to a wide range of programmes in Rwanda , in areas ranging from democracy and governance to health , HIV / AIDS , rural economic growth and food security .
Some of those programmes are dedicated to advancing justice and reconciliation at the local and national levels .
Of particular relevance to the draft resolution is the fact that we provide funding for the Genocide Survivors Fund , which awards scholarships to survivors .
In addition , we provide 25 per cent of the funding for the Criminal Tribunal to try and sentence the perpetrators of the 1994 genocide .
These are significant contributions that testify to the strength of our commitment to fighting genocide and to bringing the perpetrators to justice .
Our position on operative paragraph 5 reflects our conviction that the enhanced authority , efficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations depends in part on budget reform .
The President : The Assembly will now take a decision on draft resolution A /60 / L.34 , entitled “ Assistance to survivors of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda , particularly orphans , widows and victims of sexual violence ” .
We have a number of additional sponsors : Burundi , Croatia , Italy , Monaco , Norway , Slovenia , South Africa , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Tunisia .
May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution A /60 / L.34 ?
The draft resolution was adopted ( resolution 60/225 ) .
The President : I now give the floor to the representative of Nigeria in explanation of vote after the vote .
Mr. Idoko ( Nigeria ) : I will not take much time , given that we are already late into the night — and into our holidays .
I am grateful to members for the adoption of this resolution without a vote .
We also wish to recall that a similar resolution was adopted without a vote last year .
Tonight 's adoption once more demonstrates the understanding and the support that members have shown not only for the resolution but for the situation of the survivors of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda .
I also wish to thank those delegations which participated in the negotiations on the draft resolution for the level of understanding and flexibility that they demonstrated in the course of the consultations .
Our appreciation also goes to the countries that sponsored the draft resolution .
I wish members a wonderful holiday break .
The President : The General Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its consideration of sub-item ( a ) of agenda item 73 .
Reports of the First , Second , Third and Fifth Committees
The President : The General Assembly will now take up the remaining reports of the three Committees as follows : the report of the First Committee on agenda item 97 ; the reports of the Second Committee on sub-item ( c ) of agenda item 54 and sub-item ( a ) of agenda item 55 ; and the reports of the Third Committee on agenda items 64 , 67 and sub-items ( b ) and ( c ) of agenda item 71 .
Thereafter , the General Assembly will also take up the reports of the Fifth Committee on agenda items 121 , 122 , 127 to 129 , 132 , 134 , 135 , 123 , 124 and 122.
If there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure , I shall take it that the General Assembly decides not to discuss the reports of the four Committees before the Assembly today .
It was so decided .
The President : Statements will therefore be limited to explanations of vote .
The positions of delegations regarding the recommendations of these four Committees have been made clear in the Committees and are reflected in the relevant official records .
May I remind members that , under paragraph 7 of decision 34/401 , the General Assembly agreed that
“ When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting , a delegation should , as far as possible , explain its vote only once , i.e. , either in the Committee or in plenary meeting , unless that delegation 's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee ” .
May I remind delegations that , also in accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401 , explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats .
Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the First , Second , Third and Fifth Committees , I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Committees , unless notified otherwise in advance .
That means that , where separate or recorded votes were taken , we will do the same .
I should also hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the respective Committee .

The President : I shall now give the floor to those representatives wishing to speak in explanation of position on the resolutions just adopted .
Sir Emyr Jones Parry ( United Kingdom ) : I have the pleasure to speak on behalf of the European Union .
Tonight 's agreement is a good outcome for the United Nations .
We have a two - year budget with substantial resources and an assessment for one year , which means that all Member States are expected to make contributions as required by the Charter .
The European Union has been actively involved in negotiations , and we hope that we have played our part in bridging the differences which did exist .
The budget and the associated resolutions bring together the different challenges facing the United Nations , many of which were set out in the summit outcome document .
We have recently made some modest progress on implementation of that document .
Next year the European Union looks forward to much more progress as we work together to fulfil our commitments .
Management reform is for all of us a priority , and the summit has set a timetable for us , so those results should be available when we come to consider the request by the Secretary - General for the expenditure authority for the second tranche envisaged for 2006 .
In working on the discussions on paragraph 3 of the budget appropriation resolution , the negotiators were agreed on the importance of the budget permitting the continuous functioning of the United Nations , but , equally , it was acknowledged that the Secretary - General 's request would be treated on its merits , with no automaticity .
The European Union will continue to work actively with colleagues next year in order to achieve the necessary reforms and to make the progress expected of us as set out at the summit .
We are confident that the Assembly will generate progress on these aspects to build on what we have achieved tonight and that therefore the budget in its entirety will be implemented as we would expect .
Mr. President , if I could end on a personal note and thank you not just for your leadership on this particular issue but also for having given up the possibility of getting home to Sweden for Christmas in order to make sure that this went through .
We salute you for that , and we wish all our colleagues a very happy holiday .
The President : I thank the representative of the United Kingdom for his greetings related to the Christmas celebration .
Mr. Neil ( Jamaica ) : The Group of 77 and China agreed to the adoption , without a vote , of the resolution on the biennium budget for 2006 - 2007 and the accompanying appropriations resolution .
However , we have to express some serious concerns and reservations .
First , as to process , as you yourself have said frequently , Mr. President , negotiations and decision - making in the United Nations should be conducted in the context of an open , transparent and inclusive process .
To that end , there are established arrangements through the Committee structure .
Unfortunately , what happened on this occasion did not meet the required high standards .
The process was conducted in a closed group , behind closed doors .
We recognize the constraints of time and of pressures to complete consideration of the agenda and especially to adopt a budget for the biennium .
It was a critical objective that needed to be fulfilled in order to avoid plunging the Organization into a crisis .
But it is , unfortunately , becoming all too frequent for negotiations and decision - making to take place in a closed group .
These procedures have to change ; otherwise , the integrity of consensus decisions will be open to question .
On this occasion , there was considerable dissatisfaction in the Group of 77 and China at the bypassing of the Fifth Committee in the negotiation of the budget .
Secondly , as to substance , we are pleased that we were able to arrive at a consensus on a budget for the next biennium .
We believe that it is a good budget , and those in the negotiations contributed to a good outcome .
The Group of 77 and China negotiated constructively , in good faith , throughout the process towards achieving that result and made many compromises and gestures to accommodate other parties .
However , we have to express our gravest reservations at the inclusion in paragraph 3 of the appropriations resolution of a spending limitation of $ 950 million .
This has nullified to a great extent the fruits of our efforts , because it effectively reduces the biennium budget to a six - month budget .
It is a serious aberration in our budgetary arrangements for such a spending limitation to be imposed on the Secretary - General .
Worse is the purpose , which is to apply pressure on Member States to act under the pain of deprivation of funding for the Organization .
This is contrary to the spirit of the Charter , which requires Member States to fulfil their obligations with regard to the financing of the United Nations .
The introduction of conditionalities into the system through the control of the purse is a very troubling and regrettable tendency .
As it has consistently stated and demonstrated , the Group of 77 and China supports reform for better management and improved efficiency in the Secretariat .
Our heads of Government have pledged their support , and our delegations are working towards fulfilling that commitment .
We will not always agree on all proposals , and we will continue to judge proposals on their merits .
Unfortunately , a veritable sword of Damocles has now been placed over our heads in the form of a threat to United Nations financing , coming from the largest contributors to the budget .
That is why , in many respects , this is a sad occasion for us .
The Group of 77 and China 77 rejects conditionalities , and we oppose the imposition of the spending limit on the Secretary - General .
But we were faced with a very difficult choice .
We did not wish to risk a serious financial crisis for the Organization , which would have resulted from the failure to adopt a budget .
We therefore decided not to call for a vote on the imposition of the spending cap , despite our strong objection .
The Group of 77 and China wishes to state , for the record , that we regard this action as an exceptional measure which should not be treated as a precedent .
It should never be repeated .
We wish also to state that it is our expectation that the membership will ensure that the request for further spending of the outstanding balance will be honoured when the Secretary - General makes his request in mid-year 2006 .
Mr. Oshima ( Japan ) : Mr. President , the delegation of Japan welcomes the adoption of the 2006 - 2007 biennium budget by consensus .
We thank you for your strong leadership , under which negotiations leading to its adoption by consensus were conducted .
Many delegations participated actively in the budget negotiations and made important contributions .
In that regard , I wish to note with appreciation the key role played by Ambassador Sir Emyr Jones Parry of the United Kingdom and Ambassador Stafford Neil of Jamaica , Chairman of the Group of 77 .
Incorporating the early harvest results of the summit outcome document into the biennial budget has been a complicated process .
The position that my delegation has taken throughout this process reflects our deep commitment to the reform of our Organization and our conviction that this must be achieved early in the current session of the General Assembly .
It is our expectation that in the next six months or so , we will , and must , make substantial progress on management reform issues .
Our progress will have to be assessed and reflected appropriately in the process of reaching a General Assembly decision on the adjustment to the budget .
To ensure this , we needed a mechanism that would enhance our discussions in the early part of next year .
The agreed compromise solution we have reached for such a mechanism is unique and , we believe , shows the collective determination of the entire membership that we all are serious about reform .
It is my delegation 's understanding that paragraph 3 of the appropriations resolution does not mean automaticity of approval of the Secretary - General 's request for spending authority .
Neither should this paragraph be seen as a conditionality in order to force any budget decision .
Rather , my delegation regards the compromise solution as concrete evidence of Member States ' firm determination to realize , in good faith , the implementation of United Nations reform , as our leaders resolved at the September summit .
We welcome the adoption of the budget and intend to participate actively and constructively in all of the reform discussions beginning early next year .
Mr. Kumalo ( South Africa ) : My delegation joined the consensus today despite our serious reservations about the process that led to the agreement on this budget .
We agreed to it only because we believe in the ideals for which the Organization stands .
We did so because we support the reform efforts upon which we embarked in September .
However , we wish to state very , very clearly that there should be no illusion that we will be able to support such an action in the future , because we believe that it is totally exceptional .
We will not allow the budget to be used as a means to abolish mandates that we support and that fall outside the scope of the summit decision .
We do not believe that anything can prevent us from making certain that the Organization acts in the interests of both the developed and the developing countries .
Most persuasive to us was the fact that the Secretary - General himself told us that he could live with this budget , albeit with great reluctance on the part of the Secretariat .
We joined the consensus so as to ensure that the United Nations is provided with a realistic budget and predictable resources in the coming years .
However , in placing conditionalities on expenditure , we have failed to live up to our responsibility .
We are concerned by the impact that this political decision will have on the functioning of the United Nations .
There is a misperception regarding the reform agenda being pursued by some Member States — that only they can force others to accept their vision of reform , by resorting to coercive measures .
That is clearly undesirable and not conducive to a transparent process and an honest attempt to adopt reform measures .
South Africa supports United Nations reform , but we believe in the equality of all Member States , despite our different levels of contribution to the Organization 's resources .
On a personal note , Mr. President , let me wish you the best of whatever little holiday is left .
I am delighted to be going back to my grandsons , who have been waiting for me all this time .
Mr. Wolff ( United States of America ) : The United States welcomes today 's General Assembly decision to approve budgetary arrangements that will permit ongoing United Nations operations and activities while Member States continue discussions on implementing the reforms they agreed to during the September 2005 world summit .
The agreement establishes a biennium budget with a first - year assessment in which the Secretary - General is authorized to spend $ 950 million — or about six months of expenditures — pending further action by the General Assembly .
That decision provides the United Nations with sufficient resources to continue its operations , while underscoring the collective commitment by Member States to achieve a stronger , more effective and more accountable Organization .
These reforms , therefore , are in the interests of every Member State .
Today 's agreement also provides for the establishment of an ethics office with adequate resources to commence its important functions , for the conduct of an independent external evaluation of United Nations auditing and oversight systems in order to identify measures for strengthening those important systems , and for the creation of an independent audit advisory committee .
These are all critical achievements reflecting our shared objectives .
The United States also stands ready to continue deliberations with our colleagues , as well as with Secretariat officials , on the best ways to make more progress on the other reforms agreed at the summit , including the comprehensive review of United Nations mandates and the assessment of human resources and budget regulations .
It is clear that in six months , we can assess progress on management reform issues and then decide how to address resource questions for the remainder of 2006 .
We have the ability — which the negotiators of the resolutions have acknowledged — to refrain from joining consensus on the next budget decision .
We earnestly hope , of course , that progress on reform measures will be more than sufficient to support a continuation of the budget for the remainder of 2006 .
All of these improvements will strengthen the Organization and increase its credibility so that it can better carry out the priorities that Member States have agreed to .
The United States looks forward to our continued collective engagement on these matters .
Mr. Dauth ( Australia ) : Like others , let me thank you , Mr. President , for giving up your Christmas with your family .
I am delighted tonight to speak on behalf of the CANZ group of countries — Canada , Australia and New Zealand — which obviously welcomes the consensus that has been achieved .
In the interests of brevity , however , let me , like Stafford Neil , simply speak for the record and , in so doing , associate CANZ with the statements made by the representatives of the United Kingdom — on behalf of the European Union — Japan and the United States .
They expressed the hope that the adoption of the budget will signal a strong continuing commitment to reform and follow - up to the commitments made by our leaders at the summit .
In that vein , it must be clear , therefore , that CANZ does not regard our budget undertaking as entailing any automatic commitment or agreement to expenditure proposals for the remainder of 2006 .
I could speak at greater length and deliver that message less precisely , but , in the interests of getting out of here , let me just stop at that point .
Mr. Iosifov ( Russian Federation ) ( spoke in Russian ) : From the very outset of the negotiations , the Russian delegation consistently advocated the adoption of a full - fledged United Nations budget for the next biennium .
The adoption of a 2006 - 2007 budget will contribute to the Organization 's efforts to implement the extremely important reforms — including in the area of management — proceeding from the decisions agreed at the 2005 summit .
We emphasize once again the urgent need to continue the reform process in order to enhance and strengthen the accountability of the Secretariat to Member States .
Mr. Abdelaziz ( Egypt ) : Now that we have adopted the United Nations biennium budget without a vote , my delegation , in addition to fully subscribing to the remarks made by the Chairman of the Group of 77 and China , would like to highlight some important aspects that determined — and will continue to determine — our position in dealing with budget - related issues .
First , while we support the full and speedy implementation of the agreed reforms set out in the 2005 outcome document ( resolution 60/ 1 ) , we do not believe that the United Nations budget should be held hostage to the implementation of those reforms .
In our view , the United Nations is much bigger than reform , and we should always ensure together that the United Nations gets the necessary funds to enable it to honestly and objectively carry out all the mandates adopted by its Member States .
Secondly , the setting of a cap on the Secretary - General 's authorization to spend from the budget in 2006 is on an exceptional basis and should not constitute a precedent to followed at any time in the future .
Thirdly , we stress the need to maintain the necessary balance among the activities of the General Assembly , the Fifth Committee , the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions , the Committee for Programme and Coordination and other organs dealing with United Nations budgetary and financing issues , particularly in addressing the reform process .
Fourthly , we look forward to the approval , without any reservations or conditionalities , of further spending authority when the Secretary - General submits his request .
We caution against mixing the consideration of such spending authority with the positions taken on reform proposals or progress achieved on such proposals — particularly those related to mandate review , which we do not and should not consider as a cost-cutting measure rather than as a measure to enhance the Organization 's effectiveness and validity .
Ms. Núñez Mordoche ( Cuba ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : First of all , my delegation fully supports the statement made by the Chairman of the Group of 77 .
Only a few months ago , when our heads of State or Government were gathered to discuss the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals , we all witnessed how United Nations reform hijacked the discussion of that important subject .
Unfortunately , we remain in the shadow of that exercise .
Once again , reform of the Organization has been used to hijack the necessary consideration and intergovernmental discussion of the Secretary - General 's programme budget proposals for the biennium 2006 - 2007 , in accordance with the main contributor 's political agenda .
The General Assembly was obligated to consider those proposals on their own merits , given its role in the allocation of the resources necessary to ensure the full implementation of all mandates that it itself has adopted .
My delegation reiterates that the reform process is in no way linked to the Organization 's budget , and we will engage in all negotiations next year on the basis of that understanding .
We hope that these will take place in a truly open , participatory , transparent and democratic atmosphere .
My delegation decided to join the consensus on this resolution out of solidarity with the Group of 77 .
The distorted negotiating exercise that took place outside of the procedures established for the work of the Fifth Committee precluded discussion of important reports and proposals before us for consideration .
In view of that fact , my delegation reserves the right to revisit any issues that were not properly considered and on which no concrete action was taken on this occasion .
I should like to refer briefly to the text that we just adopted regarding the revised budget estimates , particularly those relating to section 23 , on human rights .
My delegation reiterates its reservations about the approval of posts whose mandates have not been properly adopted by the General Assembly in accordance with operative paragraphs 4 and 5 of draft resolution A / C.5/60/L.25 , just adopted .
My delegation will revisit this issue in order to negotiate and adopt the programme narratives in question , both in the Committee for Programme and Coordination and in the Assembly .
With regard to paragraph 11 , we should like to point out that any budgetary discretion for the Secretary - General must be accompanied by clear responsibility and accountability mechanisms .
We also reaffirm the role of the Fifth Committee as the main General Assembly organ responsible for administrative and budgetary issues .
We will take care to ensure full compliance with that principle in the future .
My delegation wishes to conclude by indicating that we will ensure that no attempt is made to use this resolution 's adoption as a means of blackmailing the Organization .
The United Nations can not be at the mercy of the political agenda of a single country ; it must serve the legitimate interests of all Member States .
Mr. Yáñez Pilgrim ( Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : My delegation supports the statement made by the Permanent Representative of Jamaica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China .
During the past few weeks , we witnessed once again a negotiating process that called into question the Organization 's most fundamental principles .
We worked hard to achieve the adoption of a budget — an issue that should have been discussed at a mainly technical level through procedures that gave all Member States an opportunity to define their priorities and interests .
On the contrary , however , we witnessed a process whose outcome will reflect only the interests of those who , because of the amount that they contribute , feel that they own the Organization and threaten to create a financial crisis if their unilateral demands are not met .
That kind of procedure has become the norm , which is gradually changing the United Nations into an instrument by which the Organization 's most powerful countries can exercise control .
Once again , we have witnessed the adoption of a resolution that many define — or wish to define — as consensual .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
We recall the metaphor used by a well - known North American writer who spoke of the “ Dracula effect ” , meaning that this kind of agreement can take place only in darkness .
The outcome of a transparent procedure would be very different .
My delegation reiterates once again its total and complete reservations regarding the 2005 summit outcome document ( resolution 60 / 1 ) , which has no legal or political validity for our delegation and therefore produces no obligation or mandate for the Republic .
In that connection , my delegation expressly places on record its disagreement with the first preambular paragraph and operative paragraphs 5 and 13 of draft resolution A/C.5/60/L.25 .
The President : The General Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item 124 .
Agenda item 122 ( continued )
Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations
Report of the Fifth Committee ( A/60/609 )
The President : We will take action on the draft decision recommended by the Fifth Committee in its report .
The text of the draft decision is , for the time being , contained in document A/C.5/60/L.29 .
The draft decision is entitled “ Questions deferred for future consideration ” .
The Fifth Committee adopted the draft decision without a vote .
May I take it that the Assembly wishes to do likewise ?
The draft decision was adopted .
The President : The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item 122.
The General Assembly has thus concluded its consideration of all of the reports of the Fifth Committee before it .
Statement by the President
The President : We have now moved from 23 to 24 December ; it is Christmas Eve .
At 10.30 a.m. yesterday , I said that I was hopeful that during the course of the day we would be able to reach a conclusion on an urgent and vital issue for the United Nations : the budget for 2006 - 2007 .
I said that we needed clearly defined financial conditions to guide our work over the next two years .
I want to thank members for the work that they have done — those who laboured in the Fifth Committee , as always to the very last minute before the holidays , as I recall from my years as Permanent Representative , and , of course , all those who were involved in making it possible for us to adopt the budget for the next two years .
I understand from comments that have been made that hard choices had to been made with regard to both substance and process , where severe time pressures have certainly played a role .
We now have a foundation for our work .
We must continue our regular work and , at the same time , in a determined way , implement what our leaders decided in September .
I will , to the maximum , continue to work in an open , transparent and inclusive manner , as set out at the beginning of our work .
We are also required to deliver and to produce results in an open , transparent and inclusive manner , as we were asked to do by our leaders .
I will not speak for long , because I said a few words this morning .
But I think that , as we look back at this autumn , we can say that we have achieved a great deal .
We have taken a decision on the Peacebuilding Commission ; we have expanded the central emergency fund and transformed it into the Central Emergency Response Fund , with new qualitative and quantitative development .
We have adopted an Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel ; and we have taken action on the draft resolution on HIV / AIDS , paving the way for an important high - level meeting next year .
But we have important and difficult work ahead .
We have to continue to work on the Human Rights Council .
Starting on 11 January next year , we will have to continue with development follow - up and the reform of the Economic and Social Council .
Tonight we have been talking a great deal about Secretariat and management reform issues .
Other issues , including Security Council reform and counter - terrorism , are on the agenda .
I believe that the most valuable and tangible contribution to revitalizing the General Assembly will be to effectively implement the World Summit Outcome ( resolution 60/ 1 ) .
In the light of our work and experiences this autumn , I am more convinced than ever about the importance of strengthening the role and the relevance of the General Assembly .
We represent all the nations and peoples the world .
Together — that is perhaps the most important word in the English language and , indeed , in all of the languages represented here — we must reaffirm the central position of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative , policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations , as our leaders phrased it during the meeting in September .
So at this , the end of the working season and the beginning of the holiday season , I thank all the members of the Secretariat who have helped us in our work in the General Assembly this autumn .
I thank the Co- Chairs of the various plenary consultations , the Committee Chairs and others who have worked so hard to bring about results of which we should be proud .
I thank all Permanent Representatives and their staff in the various Missions for their hard work and the quality of the work done .
Particular thanks goes from me to the Vice - Presidents , who have so skilfully and faithfully helped me to lead the General Assembly .
I tried out a joke on my colleagues this morning when representatives were in the Fifth Committee .
It did not really get across , but I will try it again .
When my staff were preparing my remarks , which is always a risky business , they tried to find out about things that had happened in exactly 100 days : yesterday it was 100 days since the beginning of the summit meeting .
They found out that , in the nineteenth century , there was a Chinese emperor who launched 100 days of reform , during which he initiated many bold and ambitious reform processes .
The only trouble was that — and this is serious — after 100 days , his aunt , the empress dowager , decided that she had had quite enough of him
and put him in prison for the rest of his life . I hope that that will not be the case for the President of the Assembly .
In closing , I would like to wish all members and their families a joyful and peaceful holiday season and a prosperous and successful new year .
I trust that we will all have an opportunity to rest and recharge our batteries over the coming days .
I look forward to welcoming members back in January to continue our work with renewed energy , determination and , above all , belief in the Organization .
Programme of work
The President : Apart from organizational matters and items that may have to be considered by operation of the rules of procedure of the Assembly , and bearing in mind that consideration and action have already been taken by the Assembly on a majority of items thus far , I should like to inform members that the following items remain on the agenda for consideration during the sixtieth session of the General Assembly : agenda items 10 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 32 , 40 , 41 , 44 to 46 , 48 ( a ) , 49 , 54 ( b ) , 55 ( a ) , 72 , 73 ( a ) , 108 , 112 ( a ) , ( c ) and ( d ) , 114 , 116 to 152 , 154 and 160 .
With that , I wish all members happy holidays .

FOURTH Report of Slovakia Submitted pursuant to Paragraph 6 of Security Council Resolution 1373 ( 2001 ) of 28 September 2001
( REPLY to the letter of 8 October 2004 from the Counter - terrorism committee containing additional questions / comments on the supplementary report of slovakia )
Bratislava , 24 January 2004
Implementation of measures
Ad 1.1.
Regarding the question of effective criminalization of the financing of terrorism :
Paragraph 1 ( b ) of Resolution 1373 ( 2001 ) reads : “ all States shall criminalize the wilful provision or collection , by any means , directly or indirectly , of funds by their nationals or in their territories with the intention that the funds should be used , or in the knowledge that they are to be used , in order to carry out terrorist acts ” .
According to the opinion of the CTC concerning criminalization of the financing of terrorism , provisions of Sections 7 and 10 of the Slovak Criminal Code do not meet the stipulations for effective implementation of paragraph 1 ( b ) of the Resolution , and the stipulations of the International Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism , and the financing of terrorism is not established as a separate criminal offence per se .
In this connection we point to the fact that the provisions of Sections 7 and 10 of the Slovak Criminal Code , which concern the preparation for and participation in a criminal offence , are applicable to particularly serious criminal offences ( including terrorism , setting up , masterminding or supporting a criminal or a terrorist group , etc. ) , and although the financing of terrorism is not established as a separate criminal offence , the provisions of Sections 7 and 10 do fulfil the requirement of effective implementation of both paragraph 1 ( b ) of the Resolution and of the International Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism .
Section 7 stipulates that even preparation of a crime is a punishable offence , and defines the punishment for the persons involved ; thus , also as regards the financing of terrorism , any activity involving the acquisition or adaptation of means or instrumentalities that are to be used to commit a particularly serious criminal offence , associating , teaming up , aiding or abetting to commit such crime , or any other deliberate creation of conditions for its commission constitute a punishable offence .
As regards criminal attempts or completed crimes , Section 10 criminalizes participation in a crime not only when it has the form of organising or instigating a crime , but also when it has the form of abetting a crime , mainly by procuring the instrumentalities for committing the crime , eliminating obstacles , counselling , reinforcing the criminal intent , or promising to contribute to the commission of crime .
In addition , we point to Section 185 a paragraph 2 of the Slovak Criminal Code ( setting up , masterminding or supporting a criminal or a terrorist group ) , which criminalizes not only the setting up , masterminding or membership in a terrorist group , but also any other activity carried out for the benefit of to support such group .
All the above provisions of the Criminal Code implicitly criminalize any act involving the use of financial means to commit the acts of terrorism , i.e. individual stages of the commission of criminal acts - preparation for a crime , attempt at a crime , completed crime , or participation in a crime .
According to the UNODC documents , this fact alone sufficiently meets the stipulations regarding criminalization in the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism ( UN Legislative Guide to the Universal Anti-terrorism Conventions and Protocols , 8th May 2003 ) .
The fact that Sections 7 and 10 of the Criminal Code criminalize the financing of terrorism was also recognised in the final report of CTC expert advisers , Terrorism Prevention Branch , Division for Treaty Affaires of 21 October 2003 , drawn up in the framework of legislative assistance provided by the UNODC to the Slovak Republic with a view to establishing effective criminalization of the financing of terrorism .
The report states , inter alia :
“ The Slovak Republic is party to all twelve universal instruments against terrorism .
The participants jointly concluded that the Slovak legislation was in general compliance with the requirements of these instruments .
The following was also noted during a very positive exchange of information and experiences between the UNODC officers and the representatives of the Slovak Republic :
Offences established by the universal anti-terrorism instruments are covered by Articles 93 , 93 ( a ) , 94 , 185 ( a ) ( 2 ) of amended Criminal Code of the Slovak Republic .
Suppression of the financing of terrorism : Criminalization of this act is included under the provision on the preparation of the criminal offence in the amended Criminal Code ( Art. 7 - collection of funds for a terrorist act means preparation for a criminal offence and Art. 10 - provisions of funds for a terrorist act or procuring the means to aid this act ) .
For UNODC it means that this offence is not established as a separate offence in the Slovak Criminal Code , but is covered by Sections 7 and 10 of the Code The UNODC will report to the Counter Terrorism Committee and to the Council of Europe on the results of the workshop . ”
The report was explicitly mentioned also in the 3rd report of the Slovak Republic to which it was annexed .
In our view , the report provides an adequate answer to the question concerning the criminalization of the financing of terrorism .
Paragraph 2 ( e ) of the Resolution requires the States to criminalize not only the financing of terrorism , but also planning and all forms of supporting terrorism , i.e. including the recruitment to terrorist groups , supply of weapons , access to computer technology , maintaining contacts , etc. and , in paragraph 3 ( d ) , urges the States to adhere to the twelve international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism .
Nine of them formulate special requirements concerning the criminalization of various forms of participation in special forms of terrorism .
It is not necessary to establish dozens of separate criminal offences to cover all the forms of preparation of and participation in a crime , including the financing of terrorism and recruitment .
All of them already constitute punishable offences under the aforesaid provisions of Section 7 , Section 10 , and Section 185 a paragraph 2 , ever since the criminalization of specific forms of terrorism entered into effect ; no impediment in the form of the prohibition of retroactive effect applies to the new proposed forms of participation in the already punishable forms of terrorism .
In connection with the issue of effective criminalization of the financing of terrorism and progress made by the Slovak Republic in this area , we also draw attention to the draft recodification of the Criminal Code , which transposes all the existing as well as possible future international criminal law conventions ; according to the proposed recodification , the financing of terrorism is a punishable offence .
The draft recodification has already been discussed by relevant parliamentary committees and the Parliament is expected to vote on it in January or February 2005 .
The draft recodification of the Criminal Code was prepared by a group of independent experts on criminal law and international criminal law ; their final proposal takes over , inter alia , the provisions concerning the criminal offence of terrorism and criminalization of the financing of terrorism from the Criminal Code currently in force , i.e. current provisions of Sections 94 , 7 , 10 , and Section 185 a paragraph 2 .
They are based on the continental concept of the preparation for and participation in a criminal offence , respected for instance also in Article 5 of the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime .
The next step was to extend , with effect from 1 August 2004 , the definition of the crime of terrorism in Section 94 of the Criminal Code .
This extension was instigated by new demands formulated by the European Union .
As from the same date , i.e. 1 August 2004 , doubts were eliminated also as regards interpretation of the provision of Section 73 of the Criminal Code concerning forfeiture of a thing .
Thus , judicial authorities no longer “ may ” but are “ obliged to ” order forfeiture of a thing if the circumstances of the case warrant a reasonable assumption that it could be used to finance terrorism .
Consequently , the courts are obliged to apply this provision also to punish the financing of terrorism as provided for in the Slovak Criminal Code .
At the same time , new paragraph 3 Section 73 provides that the funds derived from such forfeitures can be utilized to compensate the victims of terrorist crimes rather than being put at the disposal of the State .
This step was taken in response to Article 8 paragraph 4 of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism .
Ad .
The Slovak Republic organises training courses , seminars , workshops and study periods to staff members of the Intelligence Unit of Financial Police , whose aim is to provide training and counselling on the typology of terrorist methods and the trends of the fight against terrorist methods and the financing of terrorism , and on the methods of tracing the proceeds of crime or the assets that are to be used to finance terrorism with a view to their freezing , seizure or confiscation , with the help of a number of international institutions in this area ( EUROPOL , OLAF , Dutch police , Centre for International Cooperation under a PHARE project , etc. ) .
These courses and programmes are usually organised ad hoc .
Ad .
According to the provisions of Section 4 paragraph 1 of Police Force Act No. 171/1993 Coll . as amended , services of the Police Force include judicial police , criminal police , financial police , public order police , traffic police , security of buildings and facilities , alien police , border police , SWAT police , protection of designated persons , and inspection service ; the organisational structure of the Police Force includes also the Criminal Expertise Institute .
The issues that are related to the financing of terrorism fall under the competence of financial police which , after the reorganisation of the Police Force effective from 1 January 2004 , is part of the structure of the Bureau of the Fight against Organised Crime , namely its units :
- financial police intelligence unit ,
- financial police departments , divisions for the fight against organised crime Bratislava , West , Centre , East.
The abovementioned Act also covers the staffing of the Police Force ; the staffing quotas are determined by the Government of the Slovak Republic .
The Police Force is allocated funds for its technical equipment and operation through the budgetary chapter of the Ministry of the Interior in the law on the State budget , approved annually by the National Council of the Slovak Republic .
Personnel ( human resources ) , equipment , and operating costs of financial police are provided from the resources of the Ministry of the Interior .
Given the scope of the tasks that arise for the financial police service from the national legislation and from international treaty instruments , its staff numbers should be increased .
As regards the necessary technical support , this issue is currently dealt with under a PHARE project .

The following unusual transactions were identified in 2004 pursuant to Act No. 367/2000 Coll. on the protection against laundering of the proceeds of crime :
Intelligence Unit of the Financial Police
Other financial police units *
* financial police sections within organised crime departments of the Office for the Fight against Organised Crime
Moreover , Bank Act No. 483/2001 Coll . as amended requires the banks and branches of foreign banks to submit the Ministry of Finance , within a determined time limit , the lists of clients who are subject to international sanctions imposed under Act No. 460/2002 Coll. on Implementing International Sanctions to Safeguard International Peace and Security .
The list of sanctioned entities is attached as annex to Ordinance No. 707/2002 Coll. of the Slovak Government on international sanctions to safeguard international peace and security .
In pursuance of Section 91 paragraph 8 of the Bank Act , in July 2004 the Ministry of Finance instructed the banks and branches of foreign banks to notify the Ministry about their clients who belong to sanctioned persons not later than within three working days from the date of ascertaining this fact , and to submit complete lists of such clients to the Ministry on a quarterly basis , including clients ' account numbers and outstanding balance .
One sanctioned person was identified in 2004 on the basis of notifications from banks ( the Slovak Republic possesses details concerning the name of the sanctioned person , balance of his SKK account and of his EUR account ) .
Ad .
No special organisational structures have been put in place as yet in the Slovak Republic to coordinate the fight against terrorism .
Certain tasks in this area shall be outlined in the National Action Plan for the Fight against Terrorism ; the Plan will , inter alia , include the introduction of a mechanism for coordination , exchange and analysis of information between intelligence services and other entities involved in the fight against terrorism .
The objective of this mechanism is to facilitate optimisation of information flows , foster a closer cooperation and collaboration between terrorism - fighting entities , and make joint analyses .
At this time , no uniform analysis is being made at the national level in Slovakia of terrorist threats with the involvement of all relevant security bodies of the Slovak Republic .
The Slovak Intelligence Service provides statutory recipients with information and analyses of terrorist threats and risks , assessed on the basis of concrete developments in the security situation in Slovakia and the world , and also provides them periodic analytical assessments .
The Slovak Intelligence Service and the Department for the Fight against Terrorism ( operating within the Police Force 's Office for the Fight against Organised Crime , hereinafter referred to as “ DFT ” ) gather operational intelligence about the activities of selected risk communities of aliens and of individuals from the domestic environment who could potentially provide ideological , logistic or material support out of the territory of Slovakia to terrorist and militant organisations in their home and third countries .
The risks are assessed mainly on the basis of the degree of organisation and radicalism of these entities .
They also cover the activities of suspicious commercial companies and individuals involved in illegal trading in arms and weapon components .
The Slovak Intelligence Service and the DFT , in addition to providing information to the statutory recipients in the Slovak Republic , regularly provide operational and analytical intelligence on terrorism and other related phenomena in the framework of international exchange of information .
They cooperate mainly with partner intelligence and police services abroad , and also as part of the working group against terrorism within the EU Council and EUROPOL .
● Criminal investigation and prosecution fall under the competence of the Ministry of the Interior ( namely the Office for the Fight against Organised Crime created within the Police Force Presidium - DFT and SJFP ) , and of the office of special court and special prosecutor .
● Anti-terrorist intelligence activities fall under the competence of the Slovak Intelligence Service , the Military Intelligence Service and the Military Defence Intelligence .
● Physical protection of potential terrorist targets falls under the competence of the Police Force ( office for the protection of constitutional officers , public order police )
● The Slovak Intelligence Service and the DFT prepare independent strategic analyses and forecasts of emerging threats .
The DFT submits annual reports on the situation in the fight against terrorism in the territory of the Slovak Republic to the Government .
● Effectiveness of anti-terrorist legislation and relevant changes and amendments are analysed and evaluated separately by individual entities involved in the fight against terrorism ; nevertheless , the legislative framework as a whole can be considered as meeting all the standards laid down in the EU and other international conventions .
● Border and immigration checks to prevent trafficking in drugs , weapons , biological and chemical weapons , precursors and unlawful use of radioactive materials fall under the competence of the Police Force ( National Drug Unit and the crime detection department of the Office for the Fight against Organised Crime ) which cooperates with customs authorities , and of the National Unit for the Fight against Illegal Migration working in conjunction with the Office of Border and Alien Police .
Ad .
The Police Force 's Department for the Fight against Terrorism is member of the Police Working Group on Terrorism ( PWGT ) .
The encoding system enables immediate sharing of operational information concerning terrorist activities and persons suspected of links to terrorism .
PWGT liaison officers meet twice a year to consider in detail the situation in individual countries , new trends in the fight against terrorism , and new modus operandi of suspicious entities .
The Slovak Republic is also member of the Working Group on Terrorism ( WGT ) at the EU Council and of Europol .
The Slovak Republic takes part in the preparation of analyses of threats within the EU , in the drafting of common European legislation , and in the elaboration of other strategic documents .
The Slovak Intelligence Service is member of the CTG - counter terrorism group of security services .
The Slovak Republic fulfils all its counter - terrorism and counter - extremism obligations that arise from its membership in the EU and NATO .
Staff members of individual services participate in the conferences and seminars on the topics of terrorism and extremism , and use these forums to exchange information and findings on new trends in the recruitment to terrorist organisations , on the links and ties between terrorism and organised crime .
Ad 1.7.
The use of special investigative methods is authorised in Slovakia in terrorism - related cases .
Thus , the security service - the Slovak Intelligence Service - has the power to use special information gathering means to perform its tasks prescribed by law .
Their use is regulated by law .
Such special means include the means for gathering operational data ( surveillance of persons and things , legalisation documents , cooperating persons ) and the means of electronic surveillance whose use is provided for in Act No. 166/2003 Coll. on the protection of privacy from unauthorised use of the means of electronic surveillance .
The means of electronic surveillance include , in particular , electrotechnical , radiotechnical , phototechnical , optical , mechanical , chemical and other means , devices or their sets covertly used to trace , open , examine and evaluate postal consignments and other deliveries , to intercept and record telecommunications activities , to create or use video , audio or other recordings .
Under the law , the means of electronic surveillance can be used , besides the Slovak Intelligence Service , also by the Police Force , the Military Intelligence Service , the Railway Police , the Corps of Prison and Court Guard , and the Customs Administration in conformity with separate legal provisions .
The law limits the use of electronic surveillance means to where this is necessary in a democratic society to safeguard the security of the State , to secure the defence of the State , to prevent and clarify crime , and to protect the rights and freedoms of others , i.e. including in the monitoring of persons involved in terrorist activities .
These means can be used only subject to a prior written authorisation by the lawful judge , and only for as long as it is necessary , but for not more than six months .
The lawful judge who has authorised the use of the means of electronic surveillance can , on a new motion , extend the aforesaid period by a maximum of another six months that start running as from the date of new authorisation .
Moreover , the means of electronic surveillance can also be used in criminal proceedings according to Act No. 141/1961 Coll. on Criminal Proceedings ( Code of Criminal Procedure ) as amended .
Special investigative techniques can be used in the area of cooperation between the Slovak Republic and other countries on the basis of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union of 29 May 2000 , which is in the process of ratification by the Slovak Republic , the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime of 15 November 2000 , and the second additional protocol to the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters , which was approved by Resolution of the National Council of the Slovak Republic of 25 June 2004 , and for which the Slovak Republic will deposit its instruments of ratification in the near future .
The Slovak Republic has , however , made the following reservation concerning the second additional protocol : “ The Slovak Republic avails itself of the right set out in Article 33 paragraph 2 of the second additional protocol not to accept Articles 16 , 17 , 19 and 20 of the Protocol in their entirety .
The Slovak Republic shall execute the requests made according to Article 18 of the second additional protocol only insofar as they concern the monitoring of import , export or transit of a delivery , if the circumstances of the case warrant a reasonable assumption that the delivery contains unauthorised narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances , precursors , nuclear or other similar radioactive materials , counterfeit money , counterfeit securities , firearms or weapons of mass effect , ammunition and explosives , and if the requesting party offers its guarantee to adequately protect information received by means of legal assistance . ”
Ad 1.8.
In order to bring terrorists and their supporters to justice , the Slovak Republic adopted several measures with a view to the protection of targets that are vulnerable to terrorist attacks .
For instance , the amendment to Section 1 of Witness Protection Act No. 256/1998 Coll . as amended provides , with effect from 1 December 2003 , that the entire system of the protection of witnesses and / or of cooperating defendants shall , in conformity with the Council of Europe standards , apply also to terrorism and other criminal offences if committed by an organised group , a criminal group , or a terrorist group .
The Code of Criminal Procedure lays down various witness protection measures such as keeping the identity of witness secret , changing the witness ' identity , witness ' examination without the defendant being present , examination using audio or videorecording equipment , right of witnesses to be informed about the defendant 's release from custody , from prison , or escape .
The injured party ( victim ) is granted the right to receive the same kind of information and the court must , as appropriate , take steps to prevent a meeting between the defendant and the victim in the courthouse .
The court may order that the main trial be held in camera in order to protect the victims and their close persons .
The bodies competent to hear terrorism - related cases are the Special Court and the Special Prosecutor 's Office . Amendments to Act No. 335/1991 Coll. on Courts and Judges and to Act No.
153/2001 Coll. on Public Prosecution contain specific provisions concerning the right to the protection of persons in the performance of their duties . The duties of the Police Force were expanded accordingly in Act No.
171/1993 Coll .
Witness protection measures can be used also in cooperation with or on a request from another State .
Moreover , the Slovak Republic introduced administrative measures in this field by Government Resolution No. 1137 of 6 December 2001 , which introduces a set of measures to implement the EU Action Plan against Terrorism in the context of the Slovak Republic .
In the area of cooperation with other States , the protection of witnesses may be ensured in conformity with the second additional protocol to the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 8 November 2001 , and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime of 15 November 2000 ; the latter can apply also to the provision of assistance and protection to the victims of crime .

The area of plastic explosives ( for civilian use ) and of industrial explosives and their precursors is provided for in the following legislation :
Act No. 51/1988 Coll. on Mining , Explosives and the State Mining Administration as amended , in conjunction with Decree No. 71/1988 Coll. on Explosives as amended . Act No.
264/1999 Coll. on Technical Requirements for Products and Conformity Assessment in conjunction with Government Ordinance No. 179/2001 Coll . setting out the details of technical requirements and conformity assessment procedures regarding explosives for civilian uses .
The application of the law on mining activities , explosives and the State mining administration is in the competence of the Chief Mining Authority .

The objective of the Convention adopted on 1 March 1991 ( it took effect for the Slovak Republic by succession on 20 March 1995 ) is to prevent abusing explosives for terrorist purposes , especially those
targeting aircraft . The Convention was transposed to the national legislation with effect from 1 November 2004 in Section 24 paragraph 2 of Act No. 51/1988 Coll. on Mining , Explosives and the State Mining Administration .
Based on Section 24 paragraph 3 of the aforesaid law , the envisaged amendment of Decree No. 71/1988 Coll. on Explosives as amended will define detection agents that will be in conformity with Part 2 of the Montreal Convention : Detection Agents .
The placing on the market of imported plastic explosives for industrial use is provided for in Act No. 264/1999 Coll. in force .
The law on technical requirements for products and on conformity assessment regulates , inter alia , the procedures used by surveillance authorities ( such as the Slovak Trade Inspection ) to establish whether
a declaration of conformity was issued for specified products placed on the market or whether they are marked with conformity mark where so prescribed by technical regulations , the properties of specified products placed on the market and the conformity assessment procedure correspond to the terms specified in the declaration of conformity , conformity marks are used legally , and are not modified or counterfeited .
Specified products are those products that present an increased risk of endangering a legitimate interest ( i.e. protection of life , health and property of citizens ) .
Such products can not be placed on the market unless it has been determined that their properties are in conformity with technical requirements .
In the framework of protective measures laid down by Act No.
264/1999 Coll. , the supervisory authority can impose the following measures on business entities :
the suspension of placing products on the market for a specified period of time in case of a well - founded suspicion of the existence of a threat to legitimate concerns , the prohibition to place products on the market , or the decision to withdraw these products from the market or from use in case if they manifestly present a threat to legitimate concerns , the obligation to effectively and immediately bring the threat to the attention of persons that could be endangered by the use of such specified product , namely in cases when a protective measure was imposed pursuant to subparagraphs a ) or b ) .
The competent supervisory authority has also the power to impose a fine on anyone who :
has used a conformity mark , a declaration of conformity , or a conformity certificate without authorisation or deceptively , has placed on the market or distributed specified products without a declaration of conformity , conformity certificate or without marking specified products with conformity mark , or has placed a product on the market unlawfully , has failed to comply with the terms of a protective measure .
The Office for Standardisation , Metrology and Testing is also authorised to impose fines .
The Office shall impose a fine against a person who :
has marked a document with the designation of STN , has reproduced or distributed a Slovak technical standard , has claimed to be an authorised person , has issued a certificate .
Under the Convention on Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection Purposes , which lays down an obligation to mark the entire stock of plastic explosives with a detection agent , the Ministry of Defence of the Slovak Republic has the task to destroy approx . 48,000 t of unmarked plastic explosives ( Pl - Np - 10 and Pl - Hx - 30 ) .
This process will be implemented annually until 2013 . The Ministry of Defence has announced a tender with a view to selecting a company to carry out the liquidation .
Moreover , under the 2004 amendment to the Criminal Code effective from 1 August 2004 , “ illegal arming and trafficking in arms ” was established as a new type of criminal offence ; its wording is attached as annex to this Report .
The new Firearms and Ammunition Act No.

The Ministry of the Interior issues transportation permits , which give the abovementioned data , after it has examined the safety of the transportation of firearms and ammunition .
Persons transporting firearms and ammunition must carry the permit on them during the transportation and present it to the police upon request .
Persons who are issued permits for transporting firearms and ammunition are obliged to notify the Ministry of the Interior of this fact in writing not later than seven days before the due date of transportation .
The notification shall contain the following data :
the exact date of the start and the end of transportation , the type of transportation , the means of transportation , data about the transporting entity , brand , calibre and manufacturing number of firearms , type and number of transported ammunition , its brand and calibre .
Sections 40 to 49 of the Act set out the conditions governing exports , imports or transit of firearms and ammunition by persons possessing firearms transportation notes , European firearms passes and by business entities .
The Act lays down the obligation of any person exporting , importing or transiting firearms and ammunition across the border of the Slovak Republic to notify of this fact the police department that carries out border controls on the border crossing , and the customs office on the border crossing of the Slovak Republic ; no such obligation is imposed on exports or imports carried out as deliveries .
These persons must also present transportation permits .
Firearms and ammunition can be manufactured , handled or traded in the Slovak Republic only by business entities cleared by the National Security Office and by the Ministry of the Interior and possessing necessary permits for performing such activities .
As regards the exports of firearms and ammunition , the Ministry notifies the competent authority of the importer 's country and of the transit countries of the European Union of the export and of the attached specifications of exported goods .
In case of imports , the Ministry receives the same type of information from the competent body of the exporter 's country .
The transit of firearms and ammunition through the territory of the Slovak Republic is notified to the central operational centre of the Police Force by the competent department of Police Force Presidium after it has carried out risk assessment .
According to the Slovak legislation , controls on transportation operations can be performed on the entire territory of the country , in customs warehouses and in the warehouses of individual business entities .
Everybody who is involved in the control of firearms must be cleared by the National Security Office for at least at the “ confidential ” degree of secrecy .

The Ministry of the Interior and police departments oversee compliance with the law and with its implementing regulations by the holders of firearm permits , firearms licences , European firearms passes , purchase permits , firearms transportation notes within their jurisdiction .
In conformity with the legislation in force , data concerning persons brokering transactions involving firearms are entered into the licence for the export of controlled goods , i.e. dual - use goods and technologies in conformity with Council ( EC ) Regulation No.
1334/2000 setting up a Community regime for the control of dual - use items and technology .
As regards military material , Act No.
179/1998 Coll .
on Trading in Military Material as amended does not require that the data concerning the brokers be entered in the issued licence ; they , however , must be specified in every licence application in order to enable its thorough evaluation .
As regards the issue of intermediaries , the Slovak Republic addresses this issue within the UN , OSCE , NATO and other platforms , for instance in connection with the implementation of the OSCE document on small arms and light weapons and the related documents on brokering ( Vassenaar Agreement , fire arms protocols , etc. ) , where the position of the Slovak Republic is completely identical with that of the EU .
Relevant statutory provisions that regulate the sharing of information with foreign partners can be found , e.g. , in Act No.
215/2004 Coll. on the Protection of Classified Data .
The Act provides that a classified fact is any information or item designated as such by the originator of the fact that must be protected , in the interest of the Slovak Republic , against its disclosure , abuse , distortion , unauthorised duplication , destruction , loss or theft , and which originates in the areas set out by the relevant ordinance of the Government of the Slovak Republic .
According to Section 60 paragraph 2 , classified facts concerning the Slovak Republic can be disclosed to a foreign power only in conformity with the international treaties that are binding on the Slovak Republic , or on the basis of the decisions of international organisations of which the Slovak Republic is a member , or where this is necessary in view of the principles applying in the framework of multilateral control regimes of which the Slovak Republic is a State party , provided this is not in conflict with another international treaty binding on the Slovak Republic .
According to paragraph 3 , the exchange of classified information between the Slovak Republic and a foreign party is conducted in conformity with the international treaty , which is binding on the Slovak Republic .
The exchange of such information is normally provided for in individual disarmament treaties and documents ( such as the OSCE document on small arms and light weapons , the register of conventional weapons , etc. ) , and / or various bilateral agreements between States .
Act No. 190/2003 Coll .
on Firearms and Ammunition gives a detailed classification of the categories of firearms ( A , B , C , D ) and provides in its Section 4 that category A weapons are prohibited weapons , prohibited ammunition and prohibited weapon complements , further specifying in paragraph 2 ) that prohibited weapons are
a ) military weapons ,
b ) automatic weapons ,
c ) weapons whose original character and form were altered in order to cause more serious consequences than they would prior to alteration , or weapons disguised as other objects ,

Pursuant to the firearms and ammunition act , the applicant - a natural person or a legal person - may apply in writing for an exemption from the prohibition to acquire and possess a category A firearm .
The application is filed with the competent district Police Force directorate , which issued the firearm permit or the firearm licence .
The police department immediately sends the application to the Ministry of the Interior .
Based on the written application , the Ministry of the Interior may grant an exemption from the prohibition to acquire and possess a category A firearm for :
collection purposes ( collectionist item , national culture heritage item , item of museum value ) , design and manufacture of a category A firearm , the purpose of destroying firearms and ammunition , rendering them inoperative or manufacturing inoperative firearms and ammunition .
Applications for the exemption from the prohibition to acquire and possess firearms for collection purposes must be supported by expert opinions certifying that the firearms and ammunition , for which exemption is to be granted , are items of museum value .
Based on a written application , the Ministry of the Interior may grant the exemption from the prohibition to acquire and possess a category A firearm to the applicants who are in the business of transporting or protecting particularly dangerous consignments or valuable consignments , protecting buildings and facilities of strategic significance for the security of the State and for the fulfilment of international agreements that are binding on the Slovak Republic .
In such case , the application is sent to the Office for Private Security Services of the Police Force Presidium , which will perform the screening of the applicant and verify his integrity and reliability .
The Office for Private Security Services will subsequently send its opinion concerning the applicant to the Ministry of the Interior that will issue a decision on granting or denying the exemption from the prohibition to acquire and possess a category A firearm .
The provisions of Section 8 paragraph 4 of the law on firearms and ammunition stipulate that the exemption can be granted only if this does not interfere with public security ; exemption can be granted only for a specific period of time .
The validity of the exemption expires upon the expiry of validity of the firearm permit or firearm licence of its holder .
When the grounds on which the exemption was granted cease to exist , the Ministry of the Interior withdraws the exemption .

Combined initial and second periodic reports of States parties

Mozambique National Report on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women
C.C - Civil Code
Mozambique has a long historical tradition of emancipation of women that dates back to the period of armed struggle for independence .
But this in itself has contributed little for the emancipation of women .
However , laws exist , which protect women in the family and society , and gives her the conditions necessary for access and control of the land , and easy access to credit .
There are also instruments in place that stimulate greater access girls to education , and opportunities to achieve management positions on equal footings as their male counterparts .
The equality of rights between women and men is imperative as well as the real and effective participation of both in the economic and social life of the country .
Presently , there is a growing concern by the Mozambican for elimination of gender inequality and this is translated into the search , and elaboration of , policies and programs in the economic and social processes , in the context of gender equality .
The Convention for Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ( CEDAW ) results of an international effort for promotion and defense of the rights of women and , in particular , the creation of legal and institutional frameworks to eliminate the discrimination of the woman in all countries members of the United Nations .
The Convention was adopted for the United Nations General Assembly held in 1993 .
Mozambique adhered and ratified the CEDAW through a Resolution emanated from the country 's Parliament ( Parliament ) .
In this way , the CEDAW became an integral part of the legislation of Mozambique and , as a result , its compliance is a must .
This document covers the implementation phase of the CEDAW in Mozambique .
It contains three major parts : The first two parts outline the general situation of the country in its more varied aspects .
Part one talk about the geographic and population situation , of the country , within the actual political , social and economic context .
Part two makes a brief presentation of the country 's legal situation and shows how Mozambique 's Constitution protects and promotes the equality of rights between men and women .
Finally , the third part approaches the Convention proper .
Here , the report mentions —article - by - article -- the progress and setbacks encountered in the process of implementing CEDAW in Mozambique .
There is fourteen articles in which , point by point , Government 's contribution and that of the Civil Society are outlined , both in terms of creation of a legal framework and on the need to create specific policies that promote , advance and defend the status and rights of women .
By looking at the document , one can notice the many challenges that lay ahead on matters dealing with matters that range from change of cultural attitudes concerning the position of women in society , to the institutional changes , translated into laws favorable to women in varied fields .
Equally important is the conquest of a better position for women in all aspects of life the country over , and in the decision - making process .
In methodological terms the report is a product of multi-sector contributions , meaning that the information compiled come from different Ministries and from research of independent consultants as well as of specialized institutions .
For this , the report sins for amalgamating different actors including the government , thus diluting the final responsibility of the latter in relation to its role as supreme institution of the State in the protection , defense and promotion of the Statute of the Mozambican Women .
Another aspect has to do with the soundness of data used , as it is relatively old .
However , we have tried to update most of the information contained in it .
Still , one notices that most of the references mentioned date back to 1994 - 1995 and some of these have experienced significant changes .
Such is the case of the Land Law and that of Nationality that was objects of intense discussion and , thereafter , was approved by Parliament .
However , the report is an interesting document and very important in that it is inclusive and , on matters relating to women , it is one of few , if not the only one , that brings to light the status and situation of women in several aspects .
It is an instrument that will not only allow to improve the knowledge on the situation of women , but will stir up to the Government and the larger society to rethink and to strengthen partnerships in order to find reasonable solutions in the economic , social , cultural , and political fronts for women who constitute more than half of the Mozambican society .
1.1 - GEOGRAPHICAL , POLITICAL , SOCIAL , ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL SITUATION
Geographical and Cultural Situation
Mozambique is situated in the eastern coast of Africa , possess a territorial extension of 802 000 Km2 and a population of about 17 million inhabitants ( INE : 1997 ) .
It is a State with several “ nations ” , which results from the country 's historic background and early contacts with the external world .
The majority of its population is of Bantu origin .
The specific characteristics , traditions and customs vary from one region to another .
Portuguese is the official language but spoken only by 40 % of the population .
The local languages are subdivided into three major regions , namely Southern Mozambique , Central Mozambique and Northern Mozambique .
In Southern Mozambique , the dominating ethnic groups are the Rongas , Changanas , Chopes and Bitongas in the provinces of Maputo , Gaza and Inhambane , respectively .
In the Central area , one finds the Ndaus , Senas , Shonas , Chuabos and Lomués ; these are in the provinces of Sofala , Manica and Tete and Zambézia .
In Northern Mozambique , there are Macuas , Nyanjas . Macondes and Kimwanes , in the provinces of Nampula , Niassa and Cabo Delgado .
The more widely spoken languages are Emakhwa with 26.3 % , followed by Xichangana spoken by 11.4 % , and Elómwe 7.9 % .
Of these , 50 % of men and 30 % of women speak Portuguese .
Only 6 , 5 % have Portuguese as their mother tongue .
In religious terms , catholic is the predominant one with 23.8 % of followers .
The Moslem with 17.8 % represent the second practiced religion more predominating in the region North of the country .
The third professed religion more is the Zion with 17.5 %.
The ones that do not have religion represent 23, 1 % of the population .
Political and Socioeconomic Situation
Mozambique is an established unitary State founded in JUNE 25 , 1975 , when the country conquered its independence from the yoke of Portuguese colonialism .
The political regimen is presidential .
Between 1975 and 1990 , under directorate of the FRELIMO party that freed the country , a single - party system inspired in Marxist - Leninist ideology dominated the country 's political scene .
After the adoption of the New Constitution in 1990 , a multi-party system was introduced , with general elections based on universal suffrage for both the Parliament as for the Presidency of the Republic .
In 1992 , FRELIMO and RENAMO signed a General Peace Agreement ( AGP ) thus bringing to an end the civil war that ravaged the country for more than 16 years .
The AGP opened way for the realization of the first presidential and parliamentary general elections in 1994 , and later in 1999 .
Both were won by FRELIMO .
In the parliamentary elections of 1994 , the FRELIMO party got 129 seats , RENAMO 112 and the Democratic Union 9 seats .
In 1999 , the FRELIMO party got a majority of 133 seats and RENAMO - UE ( a coalition between RENAMO and a number of other opposition parties ) got 117 seats .
The Parliament is unicameral and has a total of 250 seats .
About 29.6 % of the members of the House of Parliamentarians are women .
The Parliament meets twice a year and each session has the duration of 45 days .
The Parliament evaluates the Government program and its performance , approves the master budget of the State , ratifies international treaties , approves laws , and other norms that regulate the functioning of the institutions of the State .
The governmental structure is made up of one Prime minister , 21 ministers , which in their majority , with the exception of the Ministry of External Affairs due to the nature of its work , are extend to all provinces of the country through provincial .
At the beginning of the 1990's , Mozambique had a Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) per capita estimated at between USD 86.9 and USD 102 , for 1990 and 1992 , respectively .
The country 's Human Development Index ( IDH ) was estimated at 0,281 for 1994 , placing the country in the 166th position of a list of 175 countries ; or either , it enters the ten poor countries of in the world .
However , the country witnessed a significant increase of the IDH in 1999 , which oscillated between 0.336 for 1998 and 0.344 for 1999 , having thereafter decreased in 2000 due to the devastating effects of the floods that affected the Southern region of Mozambique .
Concerning human poverty , Mozambique appears between the countries where this exceeds 50 % of the total population .
Other indicators testify the dimension of the economic , social and political crisis that has affected Mozambique in last two decades .
For example , the annual growth rate of the GDP per capita in the period of 1965 - 80 was of 6 % , but in that of 1980 - 93 it we nt down to 1,5 % .
Considering that the average annual rate of population growth in the period of 1960 - 1994 was 2.4 % , these figures testify a significant decline in the standards of living of the Mozambican population in the last three decades .
However , between 1996 and 1998 Mozambique 's GDP experienced a significant growth , reaching a real annual average of 11%1 .
In turn , the annual tax of accumulated inflation decreased from 56, 9 % in 1994 to 16, 3 % in 1996 and , in 1997 it went down to 5.8 % .
Approximately 45 % of the GDP is generated in the commercial activity , transportation , financial institutions , public administration and other services .
Agriculture , however , although continuing to occupy more than 70 % of the labor force in the country , contributes currently with little more than 31 % for the GDP .
Regarding the social dimension , it must be noted that despite high indexes of economic growth , the majority of the population lives in conditions of extreme poverty .
In the context of the SADC , Mozambique is the country with the lowest Human Development Index , with 0,344 in 1999 , followed by Angola , Malawi , Tanzania , Zambia and the Congo.
In the SADC , eight countries are in the average category of IDH ( 0,500 - 0,799 ) with Mauritius and Seychelles having 0,764 and 0,755 respectively ( the UNDP , 1999:15 ) .
These indexes are a result of the low levels of life expectance , low access to health care services and education .
As for the life expectancy index at birth , between 1994 - 99 the country witnessed an increase from 41 , 7 to 43 , 5 years , or an annual average of less than 1 % .
The average life expectancy index for Sub - Saharan is of 48 , 9 years .
Due to the effects of AIDS , the index of life expectancy has been on the decrease in the last few years .
Other factors that have contributed to worsening of Human Development index include natural disasters , war and the economic crises that have devastated the country .
Concerning education , about 48 % of the female population and 27 % of the male one do not have any level of education .
Late entry into the educational system by the underprivileged children aged 10 years remains to be a problem in Mozambique .
About 52 % of female population and 43 % of the male population complete ten years without any schooling .
But thanks to the effort developed by the government , at the primary education level , the ratio of girls who attend this system has come to increase year after year .
For example , it went up from 41, 7 % in 1997 to 46, 4 % in 2000 .
There are differences between agricultural and urban zones in respect to the degree of educational achievement ; the ratio of the population without any level of education is lesser in the urban areas than in the agricultural ones .
This difference is about 10 % and 32 % in females and 22 % and 55 % in the male population .
Despite the progress registered in spreading the opportunities of access to education , there still remain to be some relative problems regarding the availability of vacancies , or more concretely , the availability of schools in areas close to the homes of potential students , due to the fact that where they exist , schools can only be found too far from the students ' neighborhoods .
About 48 % of women and 64 % of men have some sort of primary education ; only 2 % of women and 5 % of men have secondary education .
These low educational levels are found the country over , with exception of the City of Maputo that presents levels of 18 per cent and 10 and percent of secondary school education , for males and females , respectively .
On the other hand , the Province of Maputo also distinguishes itself from the rest of the country -- about 8 % of women and 12 % of men have secondary education .
Another aspect on the conditions of life of the population has to do with the conditions of the habitation .
The 1997 Demographic and Health Survey ( IDS ) found out that the average number of members of a family unit or household is of 4.6 , varying between 4.4 in the urban areas and 5 , 6 in the agricultural or rural areas .
This same survey also discloses the fact that the majority of family units do not have essential services , such as essential electricity , sanitary services and essential goods necessary for human development .
In 1997 , only 6, 5 % of the country 's population had access to electricity , with the particularity that these services represent a 21 % increase in relation to 1980 .
The sanitary conditions are very precarious : 49 % of aggregates are supplied with water from the public wells , 30 % from the surface water , 20 % from the canalized water system , and less than 1 % from rain water .
But 20 % of aggregates have access the drinking waters , of which 8 % meet in agricultural zones and 70 % in the urban zones ; only 3 % of households have access the adjusted sanitary sewers .
1.2 - Population
1.2.1 - Size , Growth Rate and Composition
Mozambique , with about 17 million inhabitants occupies the fourth place among the most populated SADC countries after Congo with about 50 million inhabitants , South Africa with 40 million and Tanzania with 33 million people ( UNDP 1999:15 ) .
In 1950 , the Mozambican population was of about 6.5 million inhabitants , having increased rapidly .
In 1980 i.e. , before the end of the decade of 80's , Mozambique had already 12, 1 million inhabitants — the Mozambican population had duplicated in relation the 1950 .
The rapid population growth in these periods was due to high birth rates at a time when mortality started to diminish .
During the 60's and 50's , the birth rates remained relatively stable and at high levels , about 49 births per thousand in 1990 .
In the same period , the mortality rate observed a significant decline .
The biggest decline of mortality , particularly child mortality , was registered in the first 5 years following National Independence ( 1975 - 1980 ) as result of improvements in health , education and habitation conditions .
Regarding the future , the population trends will depend on two major factors : on one hand , the impact that the young population strata will continue to have in the next decades ; about 47 percent of the Mozambican population has less than 15 years . This sufficiently young strata will remain for longer time and , as a result , will exert a predicable impact in the future growth and size of the population .
On the other hand , there is a reproductive behavior that could be influenced by socio-economic and demographic policies .
The growth of the Mozambican population will depend on the rhythm of natural growth of the population .
For example , if the average annual rate of natural growth becomes 1 , 5 % , the current Mozambican population estimated at 16.5 million inhabitants in 1997 , will reach about 25 million at the turn of year 2020 .
However , if the average annual rate becomes 2.7 % , the population will duplicate at the turn of year 2020 .
However , recent studies admit that the natural rate of demographic growth , in the order of 2.7 % to the year , will not be registered due to the probable increase of mortality caused by AIDS .
The evolution of the population structure can be summarized in three great groups of ages : the group of the young ( 0 - 14 years ) , the group of the potentially active or adult ones ( 15 - 59 ) , and the group of the aged ones ( 60 and more years ) .
The historical evolution of the birth rate shaped a population structure that is sufficiently young , characterized by a very wide base and narrow at the top .
Between 1980 and 1997 , the average age of the population registered a reduction , moving successively from 18 years in 1980 to 17 in 1991 , and 16 years in 1997 .
In 1990 the population less than 15 years represented 45 , 6 % , adults ( 15 - 64 years ) 51, 9 % and aged ( above 64 years ) 2.5 % .
This evolution shows a tendency toward the rejuvenation of the Mozambican population , which will have a great impact in offers of labor , because the group considered an active labor force ( 15 to 64 years ) will have registered a significant reduction .
1.2.2 - Fertility , Reproduction and Mortality
According to data from the 1997 Demographic and Health Survey ( IDS ) , the gross birth rate is estimated to be 45.2 for 1000 inhabitants .
The global rate of fertility ( TGF ) for the period of 1992 to 1997 is estimated by the same source to be 5.6 children for women , being 5 , 8 in agricultural areas and 5 , 1 in the urban areas .
At least at the first sight , these data suggest a reduction of fertility in relation to past decades : from 7 children per woman , in the 50's and 60's , the TGF was estimated to be 6.4 in 1980 and 6.2 in 1991 .
However , other data from the IDS97 suggest that the rate of current fertility has practically remained unchanged or it has seen a rapid reduction in relation to 1980 .
The IDS97 provides strong evidences on the existence of real changes in the reproductive behavior of Mozambican women ; the rural women currently have 0 , 7 children more than the urban women ; in 1980 , this differential was of 1.2 children between the urban areas and the rural ones .
A smaller number of children are observed , to the measure that women increase their educational levels .
The biggest difference is placed more in the passing from the primary level of education ( 5 , 7 children ) to the secondary one and above ( 3 , 6 children ) .
The IDS97 also provides rich information on the reproductive and sexual behavior of the population .
The average age at the time of first union is 17 years , for women , and 22 years for men .
However , the average age in the first sexual relation is of 15.9 years for women and 18 , 3 years for men .
Or either , women have their first sexual experience approximately one year before joining or marrying , and two years earlier than men .
The median age to begin procreation is 19 years , and this is identical in urban areas ( 18 , 9 years ) and in the rural ones ( 19 , 1 years ) .
About 29 % of young adolescents ( 15 to 19 years ) have at least one son , and 24 % have already two children .
The adolescents contribute approximately with 13 , 4 % of total births occur in the country annually .
This contribution is slightly higher in the urban areas ( 14 , 6 % ) than in the agricultural areas ( 12,9 % ) ( INE , 1999:9-11 ) .
One believes that these high birth rates among adolescents result from unwanted pregnancies , not from planned ones .
Married women and those and joined in common marriage , who represent 74 % of all women in reproductive age , on average have 4 children of which 3 are currently alive .
The knowledge of Mozambicans concerning modern and traditional contraceptive methods is very low , both in women and men .
Approximately , 40 % of women and 33 % of men do not know any modern contraceptive method .
And , in fact , among people who know some contraceptive methods better , do also know some traditional ones .
About 13 % of women and 20 % of men have some time used some sort of modern contraceptive in their life .
Current use of modern methods is placed at 5 % for the women in union , being the injections and the pill the methods that present greater prevalence of use ( 2.3 % and 1.5 % , respectively ) .
The pattern of prevalence by age shows an increase of use with age , being less than 1 % among women aged 15 to 19 years to 9 % in the ones aged 35 - 39 years .
In women aged 40 years and older , the prevalence of use lowers to 7 % .
Concerning the use of each specific method per age group , women in union aged less than 40 years mainly use the pill and injections .
Already , women aged 45 - 49 mostly uses female sterilization , a clear indication that women of this age prefer to stop rather than space their fertility .
The total demand for Family Planning Services ( PF ) in the urban areas is three times greater ( 24 % ) than in rural areas ( 8 % ) .
Similarly , current use of contraceptives in urban areas is about five times higher than in the rural ones ( 15 % against 3 % ) .
In turn , the unsatisfied need is greater in rural areas ( 70 % ) than that in the urban areas ( 34 % ) .
Finally , the total demand for PF is significantly associated to the educational level of the women in union : from 8 % in women without schooling up to 33 % in the ones with secondary or higher education .
The degree of knowledge of the existence of the AIDS is quite high : 82 % of women and 94 % of men know or already they had heard about AIDS .
The largest percentage of people who already have heard of AIDS is from the provinces that currently possess the highest prevalence of HIV / AIDS in the country : Tete ( women and men 97 % ) ; Manica ( women 94 % and men 96 % ) ; and the capital of the country City of Maputo ( women 95 % , men 97 % ) .
Radio , television and daily newspapers and periodicals are the most common sources of information in the urban areas .
However , these high levels of knowledge of the existence of AIDS do not correspond to a knowledge adjusted to the knowledge of the means of transmission and prevention of this illness .
About 34 % of women and 54 % of men only know at least one means of preventing the AIDS infection .
Data from the National Statistics Institute ( INE ) indicate that the rate of child mortality for both sexes is about 145.7 per 1000 births .
The combination of this rate with the mortality rate after childhood reaches 246 deaths per 1000 livings children .
Both in the case of the rate of child mortality and in that of combined births , boys present the highest levels of mortality in relation to girls ( UNDP , 1999:26 ) .
The high rates of mortality are found in the agricultural areas .
1.2.3 -Spatial Distribution : Migrations and Urbanization
The country 's population is predominantly agricultural or rural .
In 1980 , 73 % of the total population lived in the agricultural areas while the remainder lived in the 12 cities considered urban areas .
Only the country 's capital , Maputo , received 48 % of total urban population , and this shows a very heterogeneous pattern of distribution .
In accordance with the results of 1997 Census , the Northern region presents the lowest demographic density of all regions ( 17 , 4 inhabitants / km2 . ) .
The Central Region is the most extensive of the country , and presents an intermediate demographic density ( 20,0 inhab. / km2 ) .
Finally , the Southern region , with the lesser territorial extension , presents the highest demographic density of all the regions ( 23 , 0 inhab . / km 2 ) .
The territorial distribution of the population in Mozambique has known deep alterations in the last few years , mostly due to the diverse conjectural factors of social , economic , political and productive dynamics environment nature .
In general , this distribution has characteristics of dispersion in the agricultural or rural areas and is concentrated in the urban zones .
In 1980 , the population considered urban , that is , living in the cities , was estimated at of 1.5 million inhabitants ; in other words , it was 13.2 % , against 86.8 % of the population living in agricultural areas .
In 1991 , the 12 classified centers as cities had started to have a population of 2.5 million inhabitants .
Comparing this value with about 1.5 million 1980 , an average tax of annual growth in the order of 4.5 % in a period of 11 years is observed .
However , in the decade of 90's the space distribution was influenced by a number of conjunctures that modified the normal development of the geographic distribution of population .
Among these conjunctures or factors war was one of the most important ones , associated to lack of a strong network of social and economic infrastructures , particularly in the rural areas .
This situation became extremely repulsive , while the urban space was becoming transformed into more secure and attractive centers .
The urban population in Mozambique has experienced a considerable growth , even though such growth has been relatively slow compared to growth in other African countries .
In 1950 , the urban population of Mozambique was 6 times less than the African average by 14.5 % ; but in 1980 it reached 13 % against 27 % , which is equivalent only to half of the African Continent .
An important aspect related to the spatial distribution of population is the pressure that large population concentrations exercise on natural resources .
As a consequence of this phenomenon , there has been an acceleration of land erosion and loss of fertility , which can affect the degrees of food security .
On the other hand , little land is available for housing and agriculture , which makes people use unproductive and or inappropriate hillsides for agricultural production and housing damaging the environment even further .
It is known that about 59 % of population lives in the coastal zones .
In the provinces of Gaza for example , the coastal districts accommodate three times the population of the districts of the hinterland .
The urbanization process has significant implications in demographic characteristics of population and family units .
Thus , there is a need to take into consideration the rapid growth of the urban population in terms of national economy and social policies and , in particular , to prevent that it causes serious social and political problems in the urban zones .
Similarly , should measures aimed at replacing and broadening the network of social services ( and in particular the creation of small and medium enterprises along with that of employment in urban areas ) the migratory trend will continue to affect the country 's economy .
Concerning the consecration of Human Rights with a particular emphasis on the rules that aim at reducing any form of discrimination , Mozambique has a far - reaching Constitution .
In its heading II under the basic epigraph Rights , Obligations and Fundamental Freedoms , Chapter I on the General Principles consecrates , and we cite :

Violation of the rights shall be penalized legally , once all mechanisms foreseen in the general law , namely the Civil Code , the instauration of the corresponding indemnity and or criminal charges in accordance with the law .
After that we will have Chapter IV that deals with the Guarantees Of the Rights and Freedom .
Concerning the guarantees , and as a mere example , we shall cite its clarity by mentioning the following articles :
Article 97
The State is responsible for the actual damages for illegal acts of its agents in the exercise of its functions , without damage of the right of return in terms of law .
Article 98
In the Republic of Mozambique , nobody can be imprisoned and be submitted to judgment unless it is in the terms of law .
Defendants enjoy the presumption of innocence until definitive sentence .
Article 99
Nobody can be condemned for an act that was not qualified as crime at the time of its occurrence .
The criminal law is applied retroactively only when this results in benefit for the defendant .
Article 100
The State guarantees the access of the citizens to the courts and guarantees defendants the right to counsel and the right to assistance and legal aid .
The State ensures that justice is not denied due to lack of resources .
The Constitution still consecrates the right to “ Habeas Corpus ” in case of illegal detention , prohibits extradition for political reasons , the expulsion from the country of national citizens ; it guarantees the inviolability of domicile and correspondence .
These are the most marked legal tools of the Fundamental law regarding human rights .
It also matters to mention that to adequate the ordinary laws to the Constitution of the Republic ( C.R. ) and to some instruments of international law that Mozambique has subscribed to , a process of legal reform is in course namely in the scope of Family law where questions such as the Administration of family assets , the recognition of the traditional marriage , the marital power are under survey in confrontation with the Constitution of the Republic , and with the CEDAW .
As for the inheritance law , all rules shall be revised and confronted with the Constitution of the Republic , CEDAW , the African Letter of Rights , Freedoms and Liberties and the Convention on the Rights of the Child .
A Draft Law on Family already exists and has been widely discussed .
From the perspective of the rights of the women , the proposals presented in this Project are a direct response to CEDAW and the same were immediately accepted by women 's organizations .
The tools of international law such as treaties and conventions have become laws in Mozambique , after the ratification by the Parliament and thereafter , the government is to deposit the ratification instruments and to assume internationally the responsibility for its compliance .
Mozambique has a judiciary organization that covers the entire country , and a specially trained police force that investigates common crimes all and a policy especially prepared to investigate common criminal offenses .
The courts function with some problems—lack of trained cadres , poor working conditions and excessive bureaucracy and formalities .
The country also counts on two organizations of human rights : the Mozambique Human Rights League ( LDH ) and the Association for Human Rights and Development ( DHD ) as well as multiple NGOs that work in favor of women , namely MULEIDE - Mulher Lei e Desenvolvimento , the WILDAF / Mozambique , AMMCJ - Mozambican Association of Woman of Legal Career , the KULAYA Project , the WILSA - Project on the legal situation of women in Southern Africa , the Fórum Mulher , AMME - Associação Moçambicana de Women na Redacção , AMRU - Associação da Mulher Rural , ACTIVA - Association of Women Entrepreneurs and Executives , the OMM - Organization of Mozambican Woman and many other associations that safeguard the rights of the women and raise their social status .
The Civil and Criminal Codes provide the necessary covering to sue the State in case of violation of its duties as a guarantor of the Constitution of the Republic ; but illiteracy , ignorance of law , and lack of qualified cadres makes it difficult to work properly in this respect .
It matters to mention that the process of reform of the Criminal Code is underway .
To date , the existing Criminal Code in Mozambique dates back to 1929 , and has suffered only two reforms : one in 1945 and another in 1972 .
After independence , some decrees had introduced alterations , but none of them in the direction to respect the principle of non-discrimination between men and women , as it came consecrated already in the Constitution of 1975 .
However , a Draft Law Against All the Acts of Domestic Violence is currently being drafted .
The objective here is to consider domestic violence against women as a criminal offense .
In this way , the agents of the law and order would be forced by law to give due course to all complaints presented or to be presented , preventing thus that domestic violence is considered as a private case .
2.2 - Spreading the Information
Concerning information and advertising , the Ministry of Justice has a Directorate called DIL or Legal Research Directorate , that among other things has the objective to promote , educate and divulge laws and programs with a legal character to all citizens .
The dissemination of the information on human rights is made through radio programs in national languages , and comic strips and newspapers .
DIL produced radio programs in Portuguese and Shangana on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and produced brochures in form of comic strips in Portuguese , Sena , Macua and Shangana .
This collection with five numbers contemplates 30 articles of this declaration .
After the edition of these brochures with comic strips , the material was sent to several national Non-Governmental Organizations so that it could be channeled to their delegations all - over the country .
This way , several educational tools or aids were produced with the chief aim of making them reach all parts of the country .
There is another project which chief aim is to promote , educate and divulge existing legislation through national and regional seminaries and lectures , and using some newspapers and periodicals and community radios .
These radios cover remote communities using local languages .
Financial problems dictate , however , the success or failure in the implementation of some of these activities .
NGOs such as LDH and DHD have worked in this area making awareness campaigns on human rights issues through courses , lectures and seminaries .
With the exception of the Operative Group for the Advancement of Woman ( G.O. ) , there is no agency responsible neither for the elaboration of reports nor for the supervision of the activities carried out on behalf of the rights of women in government institutions .
This group was created in 1996 only and exclusively to implement the Government Action Plan After - Beijing .
The Plan was produced on the basis of the government program and the declaration of IV Beijing Conference of 1995 and has as its main objective to contribute for the materialization of government policies concerning equal access , equality and chances for women .
But the G.O. has had little access to funds necessary to support its activities .
Mozambique is a democratic State that supports efforts and initiatives aimed at promoting the rights of women .
That 's why Mozambique has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against women in 1993 , through resolution n° 41/93 of the Mozambique 's Parliament , dated June 2 , 1993 , which entered in force on May 16 , 1997 .
Artigo.1 - Definition of discrimination against the women
Although there have been some advances in legislation , there persist some gaps .
The Constitution forbids discrimination against women , but it does not establish a legal definition of discrimination .
On the other hand , a paradoxical situation is that Constitution prohibits the discrimination against the women on the basis of gender , but does not hinder the discrimination on the basis of marital status .
An example of this is some sort of ordinary legislation that is still in force that openly discriminates women , thus conflicting with the constitutional principle .
Theoretically , the Constitution confirms the primacy of constitutional laws over all other laws , but in practice this does not always happen because there still exist old laws that predate the Constitution of 1990 , based in the inherited Portuguese system of colonial rule .
The discrimination against women is a fact that is reflected in various forms in the social , cultural , political , and economic life of women , as follows :
In the family , women are more discriminated by direct relatives who do not give them the same treatment afforded to men .
Quite frequently , women 's formal education is neglected in favor of that of their male counterparts .
Customary mores are several times used and the most recent legislation is interpreted , on occasions , on the basis of traditional mores that give priority to the paternal power .
The raised level of illiteracy in among women and the little knowledge of their rights make it possible that cases of blatant discrimination against women are never brought before a court of law .
In the labor sector the discrimination of women reveals itself in several ways .
There is low labor market for women in the formal sector , but women 's share in management positions is worse .
There companies that do not have a single woman in the labor force , and the usual argument is that when pregnant , women often do enjoy a 60 - day maternity leave and other absences during prenatal care and breast - feeding .
Due to their multi-faceted role as mothers , wives and workers , quite often women make more efforts to maintain a job than their male counterparts .
In access to basic education , women have a subservient role thus being barred from the possibility of being independent and self - sufficient .
Women are relegated to work in domestic jobs , and to play the role of a mother and spouse .
Even though this situation is frequently found in the urban and surrounding areas , it is however particularly felt in the rural areas .
Another factor leading to discrimination is related to the marital status .
Unmarried women are often fall victims of discrimination—they are subjected to discrimination . This discrimination comes from their relatives , particularly from other women ( who consider them as a threat ) and is spread out to the larger society .
Presently , the country 's Constitution , the Criminal Code and the Civil and Commercial Codes are under review .
There is a plan that this review will be made with gender - related issues in mind .
Article 2 - Obligation to Eliminate Discrimination
At the time of ratifying the Convention , the Constitution had a guarantee not to discriminate against women ( see article 1 ) .
Based in the primacy of the Constitutional rules , all other norms should be non-discriminatory .
In practice , however , there are discriminatory policies — both government 's and public organizations and the private sector 's that discriminate against women .
But as we can notice from the various existing programs and policies from various ministries which both short term and long term objectives are targeted to women , the discriminatory policies tend to change .
In its Policies for the Health Sector , the Ministry of Health has a Program of Early Childhood Health services that include a Family Planning Program , and a program on the nutrition of pregnant women and other activities aimed at women in a gesture of positive discrimination .
The involvement of men in family planning has been an encouraging gesture with a view to improving their attitudes on reproductive health matters .
Attention is given to staff training at various levels , and construction of new sanitary units in order to , among other things , increase the number of pre-natal consultations , the number of institutional births and post-natal consultations .
Government has increased its budgetary contribution to the health sector—from 26.5 % in 1994 to 38.7 % in 1999 .
The Ministry of Industry and Commerce , in its master Proposal of the Sector Plan , has the persuasion of women to raise their literary knowledge and to participate in training courses as one of its master objectives .
For prosecution of these objectives the Ministry has decided to promote training courses leading to professional qualification for women ; opening of day - care centers , works of inquiry on technologies appropriate to diminish the overload of the work of woman ( improved stoves , water sources and energy next to the residence ) are some such areas of training .
It is also hoped that some lobbying could influence the legislation in defense of woman " entrepreneur " in the informal sector .
In its Sector Plan , the Ministry of the Environment , privileges the involvement of rural communities , particularly women , in the management of the environment and natural resources .
The behavior of both public institutions and official authorities in relation to women is regulated by these policies .
However , such policies are not extensive to private sector organizations and businesses .
Unfortunately , there are no sanctions or penalties such as , for example , the loss of contracts with the government where cases of discrimination against women are detected .
Mozambique has been reviewing and amending some laws , in order to avoid systematic discrimination against women in certain specific areas described by the Convention .
As we have stated elsewhere above , in relation to questions related to prostitution , pornography and violence , the Criminal Code is under review .
In this respect , the law that regulates Association and Access to Credit has already been reviewed .
There is Land Law ( 1997 ) , which consecrates equal right to land for both men and women .
Both national and international NGO's have been working hard to divulge the rights of peasants as outlined in Law , through elaboration of brochures and through meetings the country over .
Incentive has often been given to creation of associations and to support to farmers and associations in case of land disputes , and in the acquisition of land and property ownership tittles on plots already acquired .
The Labor Law ( 1998 ) protects the workingwomen on issues regarding pregnancy and maternity leave .
But due to lack of appropriate mechanisms prohibiting discrimination against women in these situations , no mechanisms exist that are capable of allowing legal action in cases of proven discrimination .
There are neither effective institutions nor instruments to protect and / or defend the rights of women and to effectively implement CEDAW 's recommendations .
However , the creation of the MMCAS of Gender Units Operating Groups in various Ministries , as well as the intense activities of several NGO 's and other organizations that work on issues of women 's rights , which have mostly relied on the mass media to divulge their activities , should be strongly commended .
Article 3 - Development and Advancement of Women
There are principles and political will materialized in law in constitutional terms , as we could see in the previous chapters .
This are translated into the prohibition of discrimination based on gender .
Also , the Constitution obliges the government to promote and support the emancipation of women thus allowing them to fully participate in the social , economic and political process as a whole .
Although in its five - year plan government has stressed the need to give both political and economic opportunities to women , in the absence of other laws that may formally force to State to put such a commitment into practice , and in the absence of a National Gender Policy , certain institutions , directorates or department without gender policies in their respective sectors , do not assume the compromise nor do they comply .
In order to best implement and control government programs , the Operative Group for Advancement of Women ( G.O. ) was created , with the objective to give an impulse to , supervise , and monitor , the implementation of programs and policies approved by Government in the area of women and gender .
Equally Gender Unities were created in certain ministries and provincial directorates , and their function is to liaise with national directorates and departments on several activities that advance gender issues .
If it is true that in certain sectors members of G.O. have presented some degree of dynamism and initiative influencing changes in attitudes and perceptions concerning women , in other parts these units do not perform effectively .
The government 's institutional framework to implement the gender component has seen many changes in 2000 .
The Ministry of Women and Coordination of Social Action ( MMCAS ) submitted the then Ministry for Coordination of Social Action ( MICAS ) .
This change aims at giving greater visibility to questions of gender , considering women in their social relationship as determined by society at large .
At the MMCAS level , there is a project for capacity building , known as the Gender Institutional Capacity Building Project , financed by some donors .
This aims at , among other activities , reinforcing the institutional technical capacity of the ministry for implementation and coordination of programs that promote equality and equity in gender , and improvement of gender integration in all aspects of social and economic plans .
There are , however , some problems / constraints that compromise the advancement of women , such as :
Cultural barriers related to the roles defined traditionally for women and men .
Insufficient awareness about laws and rights that defend women .
Unequal access to education , as a result of these constraints .
The political and administrative structures are fragile and predominantly male - oriented .
The struggle of certain women for their rights is only limited to discourse and it vacillates before facts ( it exists only theoretically ) .
Given that the Mozambican society is currently changing , there are new challenges for which both men and women are not prepared yet .
Article 4 - Acceleration of Equality Between Men and Women
The 1999 Constitution states that “ The State shall promote and support the emancipation of women , and shall act to improve the role of women in society ” ( Article 57 ) .
The compromise to speed up equality between men and women can be realized through affirmative action , positive discrimination , namely temporary measure that favor women in areas where they have been traditionally in disadvantage in order to balance the existing disequilibria between men and women .
There are some aspects of inequality of rights between men and women that need to be repaired urgently .
For example , a mother has no right to determine the number of children that she feels is adequate , nor is she allowed to travel with her children alone without the husband 's permission .
However , the latter can take his children and travel without the need to ask for the consent of his wife .
Taking into consideration the Constitution of the Republic , which is the basic law of any country and thereof the reason for any other subsequent laws to be based on it ( creating and ad equating their dispositions in such a way that they do not deviate much from the Constitution ) , the ideal situation would be that there should n't be any laws in the country that treat women differently .
But the reality is different .
Commercial Law
In the context of Commercial Law , a married woman suffers from discrimination due to the fact that she can exercise commercial activity only when allowed by her husband .
This legal disposition is completely outdated because the informal business is fully developed by women who do not , in most situations , need to require their husband 's permissions .
Another factor to take into consideration is that the majority of women have their households depending exclusively from the earnings obtained from this type of activities .
At this moment , the Commercial Law is undergoing some changes .
Consultations aimed at introducing profound changes that can adequate the contents of this law to present - day reality in the country , are underway throughout the country .
Labor Law
The Constitution of the Republic contemplates same rights for working men and women .
Taking into consideration the fact that the workingwomen are frequently faced with the situation of becoming mothers , they are given special rights during pregnancy , post -natal , and during the breastfeeding time .
Despite the fact that the law introduces some sort of positive discrimination , employers have often marginalized workingwomen , and at the time of privatization and restructuring of most enterprises , women are the first targets of retrenchment measures .
This situation creates great disappointments for women and their families .
Right to Property
Taking into consideration the fact that right to property implies ownership and subsequent use of property and availability of it to its owners ( Article 1305 of the Civil Code ) , there should n't be any discrimination against women .
In case of single women , the widowed and divorced , the law is complied with .
But when dealing with women married in communion of goods , the law defines that both themselves and their husbands need each other 's signatures to do away with ( sell ) property .
But in practice , the law more demands the authorization of male spouses , even in case of a marriage that is not with the communion of goods .
Conclusion
In accordance with the Constitutional Law , women must not suffer from a discriminatory treatment in Mozambique .
However , in practice women are discriminated against in several ways .
There is , therefore , a need for women to fight for their rights in such a way that sooner than later , the Parliament can approve a non-discriminatory legislation , that goes along with the text of the Constitution and the regulations of International Law adhered to in Mozambique .
Equally , the Mozambican society as a whole must fight for a change in mentality at several levels , particularly at the grassroots level , because it is here that the Customary Right of women is ignored and , as a result women are discriminated most .
Article 5 - Sexual Roles and Stereotypes
Some traditional cultural practices that prevent women from advancing in society are :
Initiation Rites
Dower
Premature Marriages
Polygamy
The delivery of domestic services is higher among girls , a factor that largely contributes to law school performance and drop out .
The law level of performance most girls have at school makes it difficult for parents or relatives to invest in them .
They prefer to invest in boys arguing that these shall secure the continuity of lineage , while girls ( it goes ) once married leave their own family lineages to adopt the patrilineal ones , for example .
There are also several stereotypes in schoolbooks and the mass media .
Here , girls are presented playing with dolls , cooking , washing clothes and / or dishes , etc. , while boys are portrayed playing with cars and waiting to be looked after ( served ) .
Another finding has to do with the tasks to be carried by each one of them .
The tasks carried out by women , particularly in the countryside , are essentially related to providing assistance and food production , while men are portrayed as being responsible for earning the livelihood , and bringing the back home .
Measures taken to change the pattern of women 's social and cultural life include the following :
Promotion of the participation of women in various levels of education .
The contribution of education in poverty reduction has implied that more emphasis is placed in the substantial improvement of efficiency in education , especially primary education , but along with the development of alternative educational models such as adult and youth literacy campaigns .
Prioritization in conception , implementation and development of health care programs for women and children , awarding or giving subsidies to the most needy households or families .
Promotion of awareness or campaigns for women , talking about their rights , including the right of freedom from domestic violence , right for self - defense and a greater participation in decision - making bodies at all levels and in all domains of political life , social and economic spheres , ensuring equality of opportunity and access .
Efforts being made to eliminate stereotypes against both men and women are :
Promotion of the rights of women
Promotion of equality of opportunity
Creation of conditions so that both women an men in Mozambique can participate , on equal basis , in spheres of public life
To ensure that the perspective of gender is incorporated in all development plans and programs in Mozambique .
Concerning the law , it is important to , once again , to mention the fact that according to Family Law , man is the head of family and that woman is relegated to the role of domestic administration .
The process of approval of a New Family Law with all the modifications that it requires and as proposed by NGO 's and by other members of the Civil Society , should be sped up .
School curricula must be changed in such a way as to introduce the principles of equality between men and women in gender relations .
It must happen regarding books containing stereotyped images .
The society must be educated , starting from the very parents , so that in the education of their children , it becomes possible to instill in them the principle of gender equality .
Conduct awareness campaigns aimed at the youth , the magistrates , and the community in general , on subjects related to gender relations and equality .
Article 6 - Exploitation of Women
During the war , women suffered abductions , violation , floggings , profound trauma , and lived without any survival conditions both as displaced persons and as returnees to their country or areas of origin after the war .
They had no minimum conditions of living and protection .
In peace time situations , women still continue to be victims of frequent abuses perpetrated against them as manifested by physical aggression , sexual violation and many others .
In urban areas where violence is generalized , women are violated in terms of the treatment received from some private institutions and government ones , including in public spaces .
This happens before the eyes of members of law and order and the society in general who watch indifferently .
Violence against women is a manifestation of power inequalities between men and women and differences in access to economic resources existing in the family .
Social pressures aggravate the violence against women ; particularly the shame to report certain malicious acts perpetrated against women .
Lack of access to information , lack of protection and lack of legal aid are other factors that aggravate violence against women .
With this philosophy in mind , the Civil Society and government institutions have incorporated some special measures in their programs that aim at :
Creating and promoting mechanisms of protection and support to victims of violence , particularly women and children .
Development of multi-sector prevention programs , including the legal aid component , health and counseling ;
Giving incentives to the creation of affordable residential sites and temporary shelters , where victims of violence can be helped and / or supported .
Urgently revising the country 's Criminal Code and the Civil Code with a view to reinforcing protection and physical integrity of women , and promoting her development ;
Initiating a special review and approval of the Family Law reviewing the question of legal regimens that perpetuate the existence of a relationship based on inequality between men and women , taking into consideration the equality of management of common goods , their enjoyment and acquisition and disposal of furniture and other goods .
Another question that should not be forgotten is the attribution of food pensions to women , and the right to adoption ; there should , also , be an in - depth study about how to treat factual unions and what best legal regimen to give them ;
Ratify other U.N. Conventions and those of the International Labor Organization ( OIT ) that protect women ;
Educate women and make them aware of the essences of those national laws and International Conventions that safeguard the rights of women through flyers , radio broadcast programs , television and others .
Study the causes and consequences of violence against women and the efficiency of legal measures .
Studies conducted in Mozambique reveal that 50 per cent of cases of violence reported have to do with sexual abuse .
In the country 's capital , at least 5 to 10 women per day are victims of physical violence and 2 women die every month , most of these abused by their spouses .
In 1999 alone , Kulaya , a local NGO , attended 500 women victims of violence .
Organizations intervening in programs that fight against violence include Kulaya , the CERPJI , AMME , the African Studies Center ( CEA ) of the Eduardo Mondlane University ( U.E.M . ) Ministry of Health ( MISAU— Mental Health Department ) , MMCAS and OMM .
Altogether , these organizations make up the TCV ( Todos Contra a Violência , or All Against Violence ) .
Each one of these organizations / participating institutions develops its actions in specific areas of work .
Kulaya provides the counseling and attendance services , the creation of shelter are OMM 's and MMCAS 's responsibility .
Work with girls and female teachers is carried out by AMME and research is under the auspices of CEA .
Programs Implemented by the Ministry of Interior to Fight Against Violence
Courses and Attendance
Inclusion of subjects on the rights of women and children , and attendance to victims of domestic violence are included in Police Training Course Curricula
Special Attendance Program for victims of violence at all Police Stations .
Awareness targeted to women and society at large so that the young girl enters the Police Station knowing of her rights under the combat against violence program .
Finding scholarships aimed at elevating the knowledge of women working with police , in order to insure that they do compete on equal footings with their male counterparts , for the executive positions available in the force .
Awareness Programs aimed at Policewomen regarding the Government 's program After - Beijing and the creation in the provinces of nuclei for development programs aimed at Policewomen .
At the financial level , and for inclusion in training programs designed for police in subjects dealing with the rights of women and children , specific funds were made available by the UNDP , in the amount of USD 40,000.00 in the larger program for police restructuring .
Difficulties Encountered
Lack of financial support necessary to face the expenses of all planned activities ;
Weak information dissemination , due to lack of funds ;
Inadequate , outdated legislation on domestic violence .
A new legislation or legal reform is underway and this will incorporate more efficient measures against violence , particularly domestic violence .
b. Future Programs
Police Training on issues related to the rights of women and attendance to the victims of violence ; introduction of these course in the programs of the High Academy of Police Sciences ;
Continuity of attendance to victims of violence at the Police Stations , increasing the number of stations participating in the program ;
Of awareness programs for women to integrate the Police Force ;
Fundraising for scholarships to promote college - level and University courses Policewomen .
Prostitution is closely related to Sexually Transmitted Diseases ( DTS ) .
Existing data on AIDS reveal that women are becoming increasingly vulnerable due , not only to a major biological vulnerability to infections , but also to their subordinate position in sexual relations .
This means that even though prostitutes may know about the need to use preservatives , its actual use to prevent DTS 's becomes virtually impossible .
The major causes of the phenomenon prostitution is poverty , degradation of socio - cultural values and mores , cultural alienation , unemployment , lack of education in children out of children , growing consumerism , and negative cultural practices , to mention but a few .
It should be noted that most of these factors are common to prostitution in general .
A study of 300 children in the city of Maputo reveals that the majority of child prostitutes are girls , from numerous migrant families .
It is also known that homosexuals generally foment male prostitution .
This same study shows that 18.4 % of all children inquired maintain their families with earnings from prostitution and that part of these children come from stable families .
The child prostitution phenomenon manifests itself in various ways : in certain cases , children attend the city arteries , restaurants , boarding houses , and night clubs in search of any “ client with conditions to pay ” .
In others , there are adults who work as entrepreneurs facilitating contact between children and the client and keeping the proceeds .
About 34.0 % of children inquired in the study “ The other side of an Easy Life ” divide their earnings with someone else ( SARDC et all : 2000 ) .
Regarding Sexual Abuse , it is known that this happens not only with children from disadvantaged families , but also with children from families not economically so debilitated as the former ones .
Sexual abuse is a taboo and it is , sometimes , practiced in families and the victims know the perpetrators .
In most occasions , cases of sexual abuse never see it to courts of law .
For example , in 1996 , the City of Maputo Judicial Tribunal received only two cases .
On one hand , this situation results from the fact that most families prefer to resolve these cases out of court through indemnity or marriages to “ clean the face and the family 's honor ” , and on the other , due to lack of knowledge about the legal system and due to unreasonable delays in the country 's Court system .
The consequences of the practice of prostitution and sexual abuse are many . One of them is DTS , as previously stated , and death from abortion , added to unwanted pregnancies and birth , involuntary use of drugs , physical and mental morbidity and the degradation of social fiber .
The phenomena prostitution and sexual abuse in Mozambique need a better understanding because there are few studies dealing with them .
A sociological and multi-sector approach of this problem can enable an intervention that may take the blame from the child involved in prostitution or the victim of sexual abuse .
More studies in this field will not only allow a better understanding of these phenomena but will also help find better methods and tools to fight them .
Non-adoption of measures with a view to knowing the actual situation of these phenomena so that the involvement of more children in them can be avoided , and lack of support to those organizations already working on them may mortgage most of the country 's future .
On-going Activities :
Awareness campaigns against the phenomena , at the same time that more information is being collected nationwide to enable better knowledge of the phenomena .
Review of the Law dealing with sexual abuse .
Campaigns against child prostitution , in a multi-sector and multi-disciplinary dimension .
Article 7 - Public and Political Life
The causes of discrimination against women that we are witnessing nowadays can not be viewed as a new phase of the same hegemonic culture of centuries ago .
It emanates from a new referential that questions the political and public spaces and suggests changes in the actual gender system based in inequality .
The right of Mozambican Women to participate in the political and public life of the country is guaranteed by the country 's Constitution .
However , the percentage of women occupying senior positions in both public and political sectors is rather small .
Certainly , women are underrepresented in the public sector and of those already working , few are the women holding senior positions .
There are many barriers to their participation : family , low schooling , traditions , and lack of consistent policies aimed at encouraging women to ascend and or occupy senior or leadership positions .
Besides the need to eliminate these barriers , full participation of women requires the existence of a separate system working exclusively for the advancement of women .
Such a system should have a support component , because as mothers connected to their families , taking care of their children , women can seldom be free to pursue public and political careers to change their future .

At the level of Parliament , women represent 31.2 % of total Parliamentarians , and this confirms the qualitative jump that the country has made to guarantee equality of chances and access at the different levels and domains of the country 's economic , political , social and economic life .
On the other hand , also at the level of Parliament , one of the Deputy Presidents—that belonging to the ruling FRELIMO party—is a woman .
Women in the Judicial System
Of the activities that if develop in the context of the judicial power the participation of the woman is still small , according to world - wide trends e , especially , in some countries of the South Studies carried through in the country since 1990 , has shown however , the gradual growth of the women as female judges in the evicted spaces to the men .

Women in the Legislative Power
Compared to the continental scale ( with exception of Mauritius , which has more women Parliamentarians ) and at the International level , Mozambican women in Parliament are fairly represented .
In the current legislature , the number of women in Parliament has grown significantly , as follows :
FRELIMO party Group - of the 133 members of Parliament , 54 are women ;
RENAMO - Electoral Union - 23 out of 117 Parliamentarians are women .
The above makes a total of 77 women , that 's 30.8 % of total Members of Parliament .
In the same legislature a woman was appointed to the position of Deputy - Head of one of the Groups and two to the Permanent Commission .
These data confirm the fact that some efforts are being made in the country to guarantee equality of opportunities and access to institutional services at the different levels and spheres of life : political , economic , social and cultural .
However , the participation and presence of women in positions of power does not always mean their access and control of resources and decision - making .
1998 Municipal Elections : Representation of both men and women , by region , in Municipal Assemblies .
These data show a significant growth in relation to women 's participation and in all spheres of life and subsequent struggle for their rights in equality of chances with men .
Even so , they still have a long way to go , due to their limitation of access to other chances that place them in a situation of inequality , mostly caused by situations of work overload .
The percentage of women who occupy political and public is still minimal .
There are still inequalities in the ratio of men to women in the cities .
The obstacles to women 's participation are many , namely :
Cultural values and traditions - where man plays a dominant role ;
Low level of the schooling and ;
The nature of some Laws such as the Commercial Law , the Paternity Law and the Criminal Code .
It should be noted here , before the 1994 elections , the participation of women in positions power in relevant public services and political positions was nearly null .
Article 8 : Representation and International participation
The Constitution evokes the equality of rights and opportunities between men and the women .
However , in practice there is no single example to cite and , at the diplomatic level , there was only one woman .
Currently , women have a level of formal education that allows them to represent the Country overseas , but the number in this area is reduced .
Some women have taken part in the regional meetings of the SADC with the aim to define common strategies for implementation of the After - Beijing Action Plan and establishment of local mechanisms of coordination .
Mozambique 's Diplomatic and Consular Representatives : Representation as per Gender .
Although it is a reality that women have had the opportunity to be part of government delegations when traveling in missions outside the country , it seems that Government does not have any program to encourage women to become part of international organizations .
A great effort has been made by NGOs , both National and International , toward encouraging women to participate in international organizations , as well as encouraging the government to give priority to woman .
Article 9 : Nationality
Within the framework of draft of the Revised Constitution of the Republic , the question of nationality is an object of quarrel in Mozambique .
Mozambican law confers equal rights to women in as far as citizen of their children is concerned .
But there are still some gaps when it comes to marriage .
A foreign woman who contracts matrimony to a Mozambican can acquire Mozambican citizenship .
However , the same right is not conferred to a foreigner who marries a Mozambican woman .
Article 10 : Education
The National Policy of Education that establishes the vision of the sector and the main intentions and priorities for its development has as its main objective the expansion of access to the education to a larger number of children and to improve the quality of services provided at all levels of education .
Thereafter , a Strategic Plan of Education ( PEE ) was elaborated to serve a planning and resources mobilization tool based on the following pillars :
Increase of access to education and equity ;
Improvement of the quality and relevance of education ,
Reinforcement of the institutional capacity of the Ministry of the Education at different levels of administration .
The National Policy of Education and the strategies of intervention launch an appeal for involvement of social agents : NGOs , Associations , Religious Confessions , and the Civil Society .
The role of the State in the management of education and the space for intervention of all stakeholders in the process is clarified .
Within the competences conferred through its mandate , the State has the role to mobilize resources , start initiatives , create norms , and regulate and legislate the subject matter , approve State agents , as regulated by the fundamental law . Positive response to these issues by agents conjugated with the action of the State , have allowed that at this moment response is estimated at 100 % , compared with the indexes that Mozambique had reached in 1983 , following the introduction of the National System of the Education .
Access of woman to education must be viewed in function of education in colonial Mozambique as well as in light of armed conflicts .
In addition to the discrimination factor that characterized colonial education in Africa , there are also socio -cultural factors including traditional education , which quite invariably contribute to lack of freedom and possibilities of women 's access to education .
The constraints add to the ones that result from the reality of the country that faces several problems such as : a dispersed school network , the conditions of the functioning of the schools and the level of poverty in which most of the families live , despite the fact of the primary school being free .
Available 2000 statistics on education indicate that :
43 % of school effectives in EP1 and EP2 are girls ;
28 % of the school registrations at the pre-university level were girls ;
25 % of university students were women .
One of the biggest problems in education is the high rate of repetition that observed in all levels and types of education ; it affects all provinces without exception ; it assumes homogeneous characteristics in the agricultural and urban environment ; it has a dimension of gender , that is , more in female students than in males .
In the EP1 , the ratio of repeaters between 1987 and 1999 represented , on average , 25 % .
It is estimated that , on average , 30 % of children in primary education at the EP1 level repeat at least once .
The picture repeats itself again in secondary education , with the particularity that the recap indexes are higher : 46, 5 % for youngsters and 53.5 % among girls .
The further one moves to the Northern region , the more inequality becomes acute , particularly in the provinces of Zambezia , Niassa and Cabo Delgado .
There are critical situations in the districts of these provinces .
The rate of failure is higher .
Various factors explain the above phenomenon .
Some of these factors are inherent to the proper system such as the quality of education , availability of didactic material , quality of teachers and the education ministered , and the higher teacher to student ratio .
In global terms , there are few girls who can conclude the basic education successfully .
Among those who complete their education , a few indeed , and due to difficulties of access to General Secondary Education , and - or professional , one can say that still few can go any further if there is no will from the Government to effectively promote the education of girls .
Such a promotion demands :
A clearly defined policy , with access indicators capable of promoting and guiding Government action in respect to the education of girls .
A clear policy regarding the number of vacancies preferentially reserved to girls , in each grade or level of education .
These policies should equally be clear concerning possible employment for the graduating students , in terms of job vacancies .
Number of teacher per Province :
Basic Education

The further one walks to Northern Provinces of Mozambique , lesser is the presence of teachers at the EP1 level .
The root problems of access to EP1 , is reverberated immediately .
Teachers ' training courses for EP1 were based on the recruitment of those just graduated from this level .
In this level the girls have access , but there are many dropouts .
There are problems of efficiency in management .
Everything seems to concur for the little affluence and success of participation in this place of work .
On the other hand , there is a need to expand school network at this level .
One way is to transform basic education schools into first grade complete ones ` from 1st to 7th grade .
Efforts aimed at inverting this situation , are underway .
In 1999 , we found the following percentages of teachers in both primary and secondary education :
EP1 - 24.9 %
EP2 - 18.8 %
ESG 1st Cycle - 15.6 %
ESG 2nd Cycle - 14.5 % .
A more general comment about the little participation of the girls , the dropouts and performance point to the following : There is more than sufficient evidence pointing to the fact that that the best participation of children in primary education is shown where the teachers are female .
In an illiteracy context , where superstition and other taboos are commonly associated to school failure , its quite reasonable to believe that the presence of a teacher could become a strong motivating factor for reduction of drop-outs and restoration of emotional equilibrium and security of families , that are often eager to remove their daughters from school fearing unwanted pregnancy and sexual abuse .
Therefore , the effort that the country makes to promote the participation of girls in education will have to be supplemented with measures aimed at encouraging women to participate in teachers ' training courses , and even to apply for employment in auxiliary jobs in the school system .
Such a desire will have to be materialized through policies of promotion of education of girls with incentives , such as the ones that already exist in some educational institutions that can include scholarships and support subsidies , advantages and protection in the internment as well as the improvement of the internal social services pertaining to school institutions .
Truly speaking , some efforts are being made to maintain girls at primary level in school , in order to reduce the dropout rate , and maintain them to , at least , conclude Grade 7 , or basic education .
Following this principle , some Projects already were established in the provinces , covering a good number of districts .
There is a free distribution of school basic materials to all children , and in the first school years of Primary Education , girls are exempted from paying enrollment fees .
Among internal causes that impact the education of girls negatively , following need to mention :
Socio -cultural and economic reality of the students ( economic difficulties , initiation rites , taboos , religious practices , expansion of the school network ) .
Weak ability to manage the educational system .
Lack of teachers .
Lack of financial and material resources attributed to Education .
Weak articulation with , and involvement of , community in the life of the school .
Absence of school services and support ones , including counseling services in schools and in coordination with local communities .
These services would have an important role both in preservation and in combat of dropout rates , in the promotion of motivation , of both students and teachers .
These services could also bring up recommendations and suggestions specific to each community on matters related to the practice of traditional education deemed necessary to preserve or discourage ; the curricular aspects to review as well as the level of policies of management and administration could bring contributions to the legislation on how to deal with the pregnancy in the school .
At this moment , the regulations are little clear , do not specify the treatment that must be given to the girl in such situations .
With the competition of these services , it will be necessary to approve and develop policies that eliminate the inequalities of gender in the treatment of these cases .
Currently , access to secondary education is difficult .
The network of schools at this level is still deficient .
In terms of coverage , in 1999 secondary education absorbed only 64 thousand students in 1st Cycle and 8 thousand students in the 2nd Cycle , equivalent to a gross schooling rate of 6 % and 1 % respectively .
Attendance of this level of education implies having to be in the boarding school , which is not always available , due to lack of sufficient boarding schools necessary to accommodate sufficient numbers of students in reasonable conditions of functioning .
With the difficulties of access due to limitation of the school network , and having no clear policies on the promotion of gender and equity , it is obvious to assume that the barriers that girls have to fight against are enormous .
Therefore , the effort of the Government in the domain of the material support that currently it offers to girls who , in determined conditions , have access to scholarships , must urgently complement this work with definition of mechanisms of support and access to this level , as well as the definition of support and promotion at immediately inferior levels .
These policies must take into consideration the socio - cultural reality , the expectation of the family , and the capacities of it .
At the national , and all the levels of education ( primary , secondary , college and university ) , girls and youngsters , men and women study the same subjects and are enrolled or follow same curricula when attending same course of studies .
Girls have certain knowledge of the available options , but it is necessary to encourage and to educate their families and the society on the advantages of these opportunities that education provides .
This situation denotes that this will be a long process that will need great efforts to change the attitudes of society .

Vocational Education for Women in the Country

Data from 1999 relate that the distribution of student population in public University Education , by sex , continues to favor males , in spite of the progress made in this area .
Globally , female participation represents 25.2 % of the total effective .
In the distribution by courses , there are pronounced inequalities .
Taking as example some courses of the Eduardo Mondlane University , of the students registered in Engineering , Architecture and Computer science courses , 7 % against 93 % , 10, 9 % against 89.1 % and 18.7 % against 81.3 % were women and men respectively .
In general , there is a wide gender imbalance between males ( 75 , 4 % ) and females ( 24 , 6 % ) , respectively .
This relation has not varied since 1992 , having the percentages of female students oscillated from 23, 5 % to 25,8%.
Though in a limited number , there are guarantees in terms of available scholarships .
The intention at this moment is to help students to be selected at the pre-university level , with difficulties to pay for their studies .
The Eduardo Mondlane University ( UEM ) granted , for the academic year 2000 - 20001 , 120 complete scholarships to female students and provided lodging in its residences for other 72 students .
This growth represents an increase of more than 100 % in relation to 1995 / 96 year , where the number of lodged female students of university residence was of only 85 .
Article 11 : Employment
Following government approval of the After - Beijing Action Platform , and in face of change in social , economic and social policies introduced in the country by the 1990 Constitution , taking into account the dynamics imposed by the option of system of market economy , there is a need for structural and functional adjustments in the administration of the work so that this can , with efficiency , professionalism and efficiently , correspond to the modern requirements of a country emerging from a long armed conflict .
The role that the Ministry of Labor has played and continues to play , and the experiences lived in the process of economic and social reintegration and the reinsertion of active labor force of groups of war displaced persons and returning exiles , constitutes an important factor in the reflection necessary and possible for restructuring of the administrative system in Mozambique , in a similar way that the social pressures for democratization of institutions were a test to the national capacities to restore a propitious environment for the legal reforms , within the framework of labor .
In this line of competencies and relatively to the benefits of work and taking into consideration the legal framework of labor existing in the Country , the rights of workers are equal in both males and females , namely what concerns to respect and treatment .
The right to remuneration is made in function of the amount and quality of work done , and competition for access to high ranking positions is in function of academic qualifications , experience , resulted obtained in previous work , employers ' needs and the needs of the national economy .
In both genders , we have witnessed benefits of protection , security , and hygiene in the workplace , medical and health assistance , indemnity in case of work - related accidents or job - related diseases .
With a view to applying some labor laws that lack collective negotiation , through Decree nº. 33/90 , of 24 of December , the government established the right of collective bargaining , one of the essential sources of freedom for unionization and important means for promotion of the rights and interests of workers and employers .
Individually or through other associated laws , it constitutes a privileged form of composition of these social interest groups and regulation of conflicts that , for times , have opposed them , thus contributing for the creation of a social milieu for Social welfare and peace .
Under these indicators , the labor sector has registered , until December of 1997 , the following trends as registered by employment centers : employment applications received from females — 155 ; jobs offered 51 .
Source : MITRAB 2001
Without reduction of earnings , women have not been submitted to work at night , to extraordinary work or displacement from their habitual place of work , unless it is at their request and in their best interest .
Women have the right of breast feeding , in two times a day , half hour each , without loss of wages for a maximum of one year ; the right to a sixty - day maternity leave , which begins twenty days before the probable date of the childbirth .
The Mozambican diligent woman has the right to be respected , dignified and employers are forbidden from dismissing her on the basis of discrimination or social exclusion .
Violation of the rights and duties of woman confers her the right to receive high indemnity , about double of her base salary .
Concerning social security system , decree nº. 17/88 , of 27 of December , sets out the basis for promotion and registration of workers and employers included in the social security system .
The system currently is being extended to all legally defined population , in function of the capacities of the system and taking into consideration the cost of living and finally , it is being extended to migrant workers .
In employment , policy efforts are being made toward the creation employment opportunities and labor force training ; professional training and integration of youth , demobilized soldiers , women and other groups of difficult groups in the labor force .
In the job promotion sector , until the end of 1997 358 women , corresponding to 11 % were placed and another 369 were assisted with the creation of micro-enterprises favorable to women , and this latter figure corresponds to 11.8 % .
On the system of remuneration in Mozambique , the “ equal pay for work of equal value ” system still prevails .
The national minimum wage is determined at the negotiating table by the Labor Consultative Commission , where Government , Employers and Trade Unions are represented .
On the other hand , the covetousness of profit and investment maximization has , many times , relinquished the principles of protection of women and their families , of the social security in cases of temporary or permanent incapacity of the workers . In terms of the Convention nº .
150 of the International Labor Organization ( OIT ) and its Recommendation nº. 158 , ( on Labor Administration ) even though not ratified by the country yet , Mozambique is already confronted with social exclusion problems of working women , particularly in agriculture and the informal sector ; the same happens to the disabled and workers who have contracted AIDS .
These are the social groups that constitute the center of concerns of the Government in the area of labor , with particular attention to the population of displaced in the urban centers and periphery , given the high risk that future peace and social stability of the country faces .
In this perspective , besides specific dispositions in future labor law ; the Government has carried out , among others , the following tasks :
Promotion of programs and initiatives aiming at the socio- professional reinsertion of the displaced and the physically disabled persons ;
Mobilization of resources for awareness and information of employers and the workers , and the society in general , on issues of equality of rights and opportunity for those social groups and for the must to protect minors , the physically challenged and workers with infectious diseases , and coordination of actions and ways increase the ability to control the measures being applied , with a view to minimizing the problems faced by these groups on the job market , looking for viable alternatives for their self - sufficiency .
With the specific consecration of the equality of women and men before the law in the political , economic , cultural and social areas , through the Constitution of the Republic of 1990 , in its article 67 , women have right to benefit from support for the attainment of the income sources in order to know to value each time more their status .
In the area of employment , sector objectives are centered in the promotion of self - employment through infrastructure rehabilitation , special in rural areas , and professional training and social security .
In 2000 , the micro-enterprises training sector promoted training courses for small and medium entrepreneurs .
The training course was centered on business management and it involved 229 participants .
Of these , 21 % were women .
That same year , the employment centers placed 2,312 persons and of these 9 % were women .
A large and important part of female labor force is found in the informal business , particularly in urban areas .
As per 1997 census , 65 , 7 % of women against 62, 8 % of men is self - employed .
The urban informal sector is mostly constituted by small commerce in markets or on the streets , and this produces as little as it contributes for the GDP .
This sector is part of the economic as strategies for the creation of jobs and poverty reduction .
This type of business can not always be considered as illegal , because their owners pay some sort of rates .
Beyond commerce , innumerable other productive activities , such as , mechanical , carpentry , and welding workshops , tool and die , to mention but a few , do also occur in the informal sector .
In short , unemployed persons willing to engage in some sort of self - employment do not only form the informal sector—it is also owned by formally employed persons .
For this , lot expectations exist ( that have not materialized yet ) that legislation could be put in place that would enable regulation of labor practices in this sector .
Women are also involved in activities that generate incomes through the self - employment .
However , there are constraints related to access to credit .
On one hand , this is due to lack of information and , on the other ; it is due to the fact that financial institutions do ask for guarantees that the woman is not in conditions to satisfy .
The GPE ( Employment Promotion Office ) of the Ministry of Labor through GPE - GTZ , provides loans in three specific areas :
Commerce , which includes tents , kiosks and grocery stores .
Production , subdivided into carpentries , some of which produce coffins sold at affordable prices , tailor shops , bakeries - pastries , lotteries ;
Rendering of services ; to name a few , these include hairdressing shops , workshops for electric equipment repairing and mechanics .
Loans granted are divided as follows : for commerce are estimated to be 99.56 % , 76,61 % for production and 3,83 % for rendering of services .
On the other hand , of 2.217 loans granted in the city of Maputo , 966 were attributed to women and this corresponds to 43,57 % and in the city of Beira , of 1823 credits granted , 725 ( that 's 39 , 76 % ) went to women .
It is important to note that there is greater confidence in the attribution of credit to women in relation to men , and this is because some of these do not honor their commitments with the financial institution .
Efforts have been made toward better preparing the activity of the entrepreneurs , in particular women .
Taking into consideration the fact that the Business Promotion Office also promotes training courses for small business entrepreneurs , with “ Know your Partner and develop your Business ” .
Courses in accounting , calculations of costs and prices were so far ministered to 2,800 persons , of whom 1540 were women -- that 's 55 % .
The Women 's Counter of the Local Industry Development Institute ( IDIL ) promotes and develops local industry throughout the country and helps women who dedicate themselves to small - scale business activities .
ACTIVA , an Association of Women Entrepreneurs and Executives , with networks in some Provinces , also create opportunities for its members to attend several training courses , and provide legal aid .
Many families see their situation of subsistence reasonably resolved when they collaborate and participate in associative meetings .
Here , besides the possibilities of obtaining training in areas of major interest and projection to business , and cooperative life , there also courses on resources management .
It is estimated that more than 55 % of women work in the cooperative sector .
Per se , this percentage is rather high , what suggests the need to take pro-active action toward the creation of more possibilities for women to opt for this venue , where they can rip off some benefits in terms of training .
The most functional courses are those of business management , computer science and English language .
The General Union of Farming Cooperatives ( UGC ) , created in Maputo and with 10,000 members being 90 % women , acts particularly in the green zones of Maputo and works with productive farming cooperatives in an effort to maximize economic activities in farming and livestock production .
Amongst some activities developed by this organization , emphasis goes to production of rations using modern techniques , and has started producing about 1,000 tons / month against the previous 55 tons per month . A slaughter house with the capacity of to produce 8000 bird / day and the ability to conserve 150.000 chickens as well as the opening of a small laboratory for the modernization of the preventive animal health care programs and immediate prevention of eventual pests before they can occur .
34 aviaries with total capacity of 102.000 birds had AIDS constructed and the sector started to have capacity for 237.000 birds for cycle while to the level of the families 130 aviaries with capacity for 65.000 birds had AIDS constructed and the sector started to have capacity of 106.170 birds for cycle .
In accordance with the data provided by INE ( 1998 ) , about 62 % of the Mozambican population aged 7 years and above is economically active .
This percentage rises more in the countryside than in the cities ( 66 , 6 against 40 % ) .
The evolution of the Economically Active Population ( PEA ) presents itself as an active participation of women , while male 's is slightly lower , in accordance with the parameters of general population growth .
This result must be attributed to the fact that in the countryside , almost all women work in the farms , while in the cities more women dedicate themselves to domestic activities or studies .
In urban zones , only 32 % of women are considered economically active , against 69 % of those in rural areas .
Labor Force Estimates
Source : MITRAB 2001
In an eminently agrarian country , its labor force obviously tends to be situated in the limits of this activity .
However , it is the female labor force that is the major participant in this production .
This situation is understandable due to poor extension of market activities and because of the gender distribution of labor , which limits the participation of women to housekeeping , with extension only to agricultural production .
The scarce participation of women in salaried work is also explained due to low levels of education , which limits their participation in formal jobs .
However , the labor force comprehending men or women corresponds , in majority , informal workers ( or non-structured sector of society ) .
Salaried employment of males corresponds , according to INE ( 1998 ) , about 16 % , and the female about 4 % .
When considering the country 's three macro-regions , self - employment seems to represent the biggest source of income in all the zones of the country , overall in the rural areas where it promotes 60 % of total income .
The major sources of income are : self - employment ( 54 % ) , which includes sale of products cultivated or processed in families , wage - earning work ( 19 % ) and income from property ( 6 % ) .
Article 12 : Equality of Access to Health Care Services
The National Health Policies define explicitly defines the improvement of health of mothers and children as a key priority .
Strictly speaking about health care delivery by the National Health Service ( SNS ) , there is no place for any type of discrimination against women .
Government has targeted women and children as the most vulnerable groups of the population and created the program of Mother - and - Child Heath Services ( SMI ) , which enable the State to promote health care services for this group .
Now the services cover about more than 50 % of the population .
This program makes use of a wide range of services aimed at educating the population on a number of pathological situations , and at avoiding them .
This includes family planning , as a form to improve the health of women and their children .
In the cultural plan , it is possible that there are barriers .
It is common knowledge that in many pathological situations , children or women from the most vulnerable social classes , only go to clinics with their respective heads of families .
There are no data that might allow the assessment of percentage of women who are part of this group .
One knows , however , that this is directly linked to lack of schooling .
The more educated a woman is , the more she is likely to seek health services .
In theory , women have same access to health care services as their male counterparts .
But , for the reasons state above , it should be inferred that women do really need to have more access to health care services than men , particularly now that preventive health care services are for free .
Prenatal healthcare services during pregnancy , and post - natal care are free of charge .
These health care services include :
Prenatal consultations
Childbirths in the units of primary , secondary and tertiary networks
Childbirths in the units of quaternary network , when related
Consultations after childbirth
Family Planning
The SMI program recommends and promotes , through its programs of assistance , nutrition adjusted during the pregnancy and the lactation .
However , it is not capable of providing food supplements .
Thus , the INAS , DPCCN , NGOs and Churches guarantee in some situations of extreme poverty , or in particularly vulnerable populations who are helped food supplements alone .
All primary health care units dedicate more than 50 % of their resources to preventive medicine .
Women are the major beneficiaries of this .
This percentage tends to diminish where specialized health care services exist , which are dedicated to diagnosis and treatment of the said women at the primary level .
The index of maternal mortality is extremely high , and it is estimated at 1500 for 100 000 living births .
The major causes of maternal mortality are :
Hemorrhages
Infections
Clamps
Abortion
Embryo -pelvic incompatibility
Other causes that contribute indirectly to high mortality are :
Malaria
Meningitis
Premature pregnancy
In 1999 , about 84 % of pregnant women received at least 1 prenatal consultation .
Of these , 40 % had made the childbirth in the maternity and a slightly higher percentage , 45 % , received after - childbirth assistance .
The rate of infantile mortality is still high , that 's 135 deaths per 1000 living births , and the index of perinatal mortality , that is delayed loss of pregnancy , stillbirths or deaths in the first week of birth , reaches 70 per 100 births , or approximately 01 woman out of 13 .
The National Demographic and Health Inquiry ( IDS ) have it that there is a need for 50 % of unmet contraception in the agricultural zones , and 34 % in the urban centers .
Many women in the agricultural areas use traditional methods , and are more reluctant to using modern methods .
In the urban zones , there are contraceptives that can be distributed via the SMI Program or in pharmacies .
In 1997 , the percentile distribution of the Population in Reproductive Age for current contraceptive use , according to sex , was the following as per contraceptive use :
Sources : IDS , 1997
It is estimated that at least 60 % of the population is attended by traditional medicine .
The exact number of the practitioners is not known .
By law , there is freedom to receive health care services from whatever source .
In practice , however , some women need permit from their husbands or from another relative ( should the former not be available ) to do so .
This practice is quite common among less educated women , a majority in Mozambique .
Abortion is not legal , unless it is for medical purposes .
However , women know some methods to practice it , and when they have an unwanted pregnancy use them .
One of the methods used in the urban centers is to initiate the abortion , and later direct it to the hospital to complete the process in an operating room .
So , some health care units have opted to work on abortions to reduce death and infection risks , sterility , and to reduce internment time .
In these cases , the uses cover the operation costs themselves .
There is no insurance for these cases . No prenatal test is done to the fetus .
There is a program that controls AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases , and this deals with general control problems .
Sentry centers record and divulge those cases diagnosed in those health care units , as well as Aids positive pregnant women .
HIV monitoring in pregnant women is done every two years .
There is a significant increase of Aids prevalence in this group of people , at different health care centers , with particular incidence in the city of Chimoio where the prevalence almost duplicated from 10 % in 1994 to 19 % in 1996 .
Also , prevalence has increased to 16.5 % in the City of Beira for 1996 .
In 1994 , the City of Tete had already registered a rate of 18.0 % and that grew up to 23.2 % in 1996 .
Quelimane has like rates of about 18.0 % and 23 % respectively .
A level of the government , no measure was introduced to insure and protect the HIV / AIDS workingwoman .
However , there are a number of organizations created , in which women do participate ( MONASO , AMODEFA , etc. ) , that work directly in AIDS control and prevention .
Discriminatory attitudes in relation to the carriers of the HIV are condemned .
In the capital city , and recently in other parts of the country , there are attendance centers for women prostitutes , working on the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases .
In the general terms , it can be said that the Government promotes some measures aimed at eliminating any Forms of Discrimination Against Women ; it promotes equality of access to health care services between women and men .
Although there are no data on mortality and morbidity in adolescents and the young , their health needs and problems are related to sexuality and reproductive health .
Among the major risks and problems of reproductive health faced by the young , such as the Sexually Transmitted Diseases ( STD ) , unwanted pregnancy ( that quite often end up in illegal abortions and the complications thereof ) , maternal mortality , abandonment of new born and infanticide are the most common ones .
In general , society blames the “ criminal woman ” , without analyzing the circumstances under which given situations have occurred .
As the adolescents are less vulnerable to illnesses as compared to children and the elderly , the specific problems of this age group have been neglected for so long , even though in adolescence some lifestyles do condition their health situation .
Given to the different situations associated to the lifestyle of adolescents ( sexual behavior , pregnancy in girls , to mention but a few ) the Ministry of Health has decided to start a program essentially addressed to this target group .
In August of 1996 , the Program for Young 's and Adolescent 's Care was introduced . It was addressed to three key areas : Policies and Legal Framework on Issues of Youth ; Education for Family Life ; Education for Community Life .
Mention should go to the creation of The Inter - Sector Committee for Support to the Development of Adolescents , made up by Government Institutions s and Civic Associations working in the area .
Health Care Clinics were opened in Quelimane ( 4 ) , in Maputo ( 6 ) .
These Clinics offer information , counseling , family planning , diagnostics and treatment of STD's , at given times , to young and adolescents , at a time when the influx of sick people is low and privacy and quality health care services in general are possible .
One of the reasons that lead girls to quit schooling is unwanted pregnancy and sexual harassment by teachers who use their power to cheat the student girls .
As a result , fathers avoid sending their daughters to school or even to boarding schools .
Pregnancy in girl is , in a general , unacceptable socially and the girl is always considered guilty of the situation .
Many times , parents may , regardless of the situation under which she became pregnant , force the girl to live in the household of the youngster , making the latter responsible for the livelihood of the girl .
There are no statistics on the incidence of desistance of girls due to pregnancy , but the existing information suggests a need for a broader approach on this matter .
Research studies carried out by the Ministry of Health and the Social Communication Institute in some districts of the Country ( Mocuba and Gilé ) lead to some conclusions :
Young people have the correct information on attitudes regarding sexual behavior and on Sexually Transmitted Diseases , but they do not use this information , there is distortion of information regarding AIDS ;
Young people have many doubts regarding sexuality and have no partners for dialog .
A large number of those interviewed started their sexual activity between 12 - 14 years , but state that they should have started between 18 - 20 years ; in other words , they are aware that they were not prepared to embark on sexual activities and exposed themselves to the risks of pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease ( ICS , 1996 ) .
Access to social communication means does not always mean more correct information .
On the other hand , the research revealed that in a district ( Gilé ) , the young and community leaders got more information on reproductive health in the rites of initiation than through the messages relayed by the health sector .
The results of the research disclosed that traditional doctors , traditional practices and religious aspects more influenced the attitudes of young people and , as such , any sort of work should involve them if change in attitudes were to be achieved .
Several government and non-governmental institutions with the support of UNFPA and UNICEF have been developing educational and information activities , namely Family Life Education , and the program is currently in progress , including teachings on sexuality and family planning .
The Health of Women and Children
Since 1997 , the groups “ Women ” and “ Children ” have been defined as vulnerable ones , mostly due to their high morbid - mortality .
The total fertility rate in 1995 - 2000 is estimated to be 6.1 children per woman in reproductive age , with the procreation ages being very precocity .
Access to reproductive health services is very weak .
However , taking into consideration the expansion of AIDS , that is becoming a huge public health and development problem , and given to HIV prevalence among adults , now estimated at 15.4 % , in 1999 and within the context of general reproductive health objectives , the distribution of condoms for males has been dramatically on the increase in the last few years , adding to 2,000,000 in 1990 and more than 10,000,000 in 1996 ; the quantity for 1997 was about 15,000,000 .
Currently there are about 500,000 orphans in Mozambique , and about 2 / 3 of these are the direct result of the AIDS .
It is hoped that the number evolves to more than 1 , 5 million in year 2010 .
These children are affected negatively for various reasons .
For example , poor aggregates are susceptible to receive more orphans than their rich counterparts , and this carries its additional costs for their survival and leads to total poverty .
Children coming from households affected by the disease or those psychologically traumatized suffer from emotional problems .
Studies point that they are girls who are responsible for their sick relatives or replace labor power in the fields , a factor that can easily contribute to their abandonment of school thus worsening their gender inequality .
Women and the Reproductive Health
The activity on the reproductive health of women is integrated in the Ministry of Health .
Besides programming , the Ministry of Health also covers medical assistance , preventive health care , and technical procedures and treatment , who can be implemented at all levels of attention , particularly at primary and secondary levels .
The possibilities to control maternal health are found in the health care units at different levels of coverage .
These possibilities depend very much on the basic infrastructure capacity of the health care centers to cater for the population .
Even so , the number of maternity wards per 1000 women in fertile age presents a great disparity between the provinces .
And this happens after having there been some evolution from 1998 to 1994 .
The following picture shows a clear picture per province , for the years mentioned :
Source : IDS , 1997
There are concrete limitations that hinder the progress of some programs directed to the reproductive health of women .
Among these , there are the lack of human resources in the health sector , weak response and coverage capacity in health services whose infrastructures had been destroyed by the war that devastated the country for many years , the cost of medicines and the non-observance of cultural aspects in existing or would be intervention programs .
Parallel to the institutional attention to the childbirth , the Retraining and Qualification Program for Traditional Obstetricians has the objective to increase coverage hygienic childbirths in the community , reduction of risky childbirths and its reference .
The percentile distribution of the female population in fertile age for medical assistance during childbirth , per residence area in 1997 , was the following :
Source : INE , IDS 1997
Intra-hospital maternal mortality per 1000 living births for some provinces
Source : IDS , 1997
Whenever there is an analysis at the national scale , existing disequilibria between the southern region and the others is observed .
The maternal mortality rate includes other situations , far beyond the ones mentioned and their related consequences .
Among these are premature marriages , the multi-births and the unwanted pregnancies , the last one being clandestine abortion that especially is used in some segments of the youngest women in fertile age .
A study carried out in 1999 , in a universe of 90 cases of occurring maternal deaths , between 1997 and 1998 , concluded that of among the reproductive factors analyzed in relation to the age of women , 23 % out of 87 % were 35 years old or above , and that 6 % were 16 years old or under .
The group of adolescents constitutes only 32 %.
Out of the women who were interviewed , 71 % had terminated their pregnancy during the gestation period of 37 and 40 weeks .
Of the 90 cases , 30 % were multi-births .
As stated above , abortion is considered illegal in the country and it is discouraged in all of its forms , except when dealing with life threatening situations or to safeguard the honor of the person involved ( Article 358 of the C.C. ) .
However , from 1980 , the Ministry of Health published a decree that authorizes hospitals carry out abortions in cases of pregnancy with deficiencies or when the health of the woman is threatened , having to send the authorization to a hospital commission ( Bugalho , 1995 : 16 ) .
Family Planning , integrant part of the Program of Mother - Childhood Health , works in all Health Care Units throughout the country .
This Program has the support of NGO's in the acquisition of contraceptives at the national level , production and distribution of information material , and education and communication through integrated agricultural Projects .
In these activities , the IPPF is distinguished .
The UNFPA , and recently USAID , AMODEFA , OMM , OTM and the OJM are other organizations involved .
Mention should be made of the role played by the ICS , an organization working in information , education and communication , for its role in constantly or frequently dealing with issues related to Family Planning .
The activity of Education for Health inside of this program was predominantly directed to women , without a perspective of gender .
Only recently the men and the youth were included as target groups .
Nutrition and Food Security
Food security and nutrition are integrated subjects considered in their different perspectives : social , economic and political .
Since Independence there have been two change processes in Mozambique .
One started in 1987 , at the time of transition from a centralized economy to a liberalized one .
The other process is the transition from a war and emergency situation to one of peace and more stability in 1992 .
These processes have influenced gender relations in these areas .
In this chapter , the constraints in the rights of women refer to the women 's access to land and its control , which makes it difficult for her to have an adequate livelihood .
Women practice subsistence agricultural production while men dedicate themselves essentially to commercial agriculture ( sunflower , cotton and tobacco ) .
Gender inequality is clearly visible in this sector where women in their triple role ( reproductive , productive and community management ) do not have the technologies necessary to increase their labor output .
Regions exist where the biggest food production of women is that of catching shellfish and octopus .
The Program of Rehabilitation of Tertiary Roads ( of the Ministry of Housing and Public Works ) in course in the rural zones presently employs between 15 and 25 % of women in brigades , which gives some degree of financial mobility to women .
Food production is not enough and diversified .
Families have low incomes and this leads them to have an imbalanced diet .
Animal production is practiced with higher intensity only in the Southern Mozambique ( MAP , 1994 ) .
The nutritional state of the population in some regions is poor and it gets worse at times of drought and flooding .
For example , in two Northern Provinces , there have been serious food shortages crises , caused by tropical neuropathy ( due to consumption of bitter cassava , improperly processed ) by people with deficient nutritional state , specifically those with protein deficiency .
Other illnesses related to nutrition are the anemia ( with incidence in the pregnant woman ) and the bócio ; in situations of bad climatic conditions , cases of marasmo and Kwashiorkor are found in very poor families .
The deficient state of health increases the incidence of other illnesses such as diarrhea and malaria .
These illnesses are more acute in women and children .
For the pregnant women , anemia and malnutrition are some factors that lead to high incidence of premature childbirths , maternal mortality and low weight at birth .
Precarious economic situation of the family , allied to the taboos and myths in terms of different distribution and use of the services , negatively affect the nutritional state of women and children ( MS / MPF , 1997 ) .
On the other hand , limited knowledge on the nutritional necessities of the women and children , and lack of knowledge on how to best satisfy these nutritional needs , has also contributed to deficient nutritional situation in these two population groups .
Effective participation of women in economic activities ( agricultural production , informal sector ) , their reproductive role as well as the lack of adequate social health care service , do also influence the health of women .
The Ministry of Woman and Coordination of Social Welfare , through INAS , has a program of social support in money to the families of children and women in vulnerable situation , through the Programs of Social Benefit for Work and Income Generating Activities .
In 2000 alone , this program attended 2,500 beneficiaries .
Of these , 240 beneficiaries had been absorbed by partner employers and have already signed work contracts .
In the scope of the Food Subsidy Program of this institution , in December of 2000 , 1,505 women heads of family households and 206 pregnant women from different parts of the country benefited from this help .
Article 13 : Social Life and Economic Benefits
The existing policies are geared toward formal sectors , and to some vulnerable groups ( the elderly , pregnant women , malnourished children , etc . ) There is no open discrimination in the concession of bank loans , but social barriers exist and that makes it difficult for some women to have access to credit .
The private sphere constituted by the family space , socialization of women with men , is created and re-created .
It is under these circumstances that family serves as a pillar to build gender relations and , in the intimacy of the household , through a man-based relationship from different sources also reproduces hierarchic relationship between men and women , with the former ripping off the existing benefits .
In extended families , or in more or less nuclear families , in monogamies or polygamies , in the cities or in the countryside 's , in all of these relationships , women occupy a position of subservience and are subject to different forms that assume the form of discrimination according to age and the degree of wealth .
In the lineage system that exists in the country ( patrilineal and matrilineal ) the character of assumed gender is similar .
Differences may exist in two situations : concerning the male family member who allows the access of his woman counterpart to have access to land ( husband or uncle ) , and concerning the ownership of children : in the patrilineal system , children belong to the father and —in the matrilineal one—they belong to the woman .
In accordance with the customary law , marriage is used as a means to structure reproduction and land possession .
Women are the means to obtaining land and fostering family reproduction .
Even though the only valid family union in the country is the official marriage , the practice of the majority of people in the country is customary marriage between men and women .
Also , civil war has influenced changes in the management of family households , leading to an increase in the households managed by women .
The PER ( Program for Economic Rehabilitation ) , implemented in accordance with the Friedman model , has been contributing significantly to an increase in the family aggregates managed by women .
The women 's condition in management of family households does not always confer a situation of power in the context of family ; existing studies within the context of the Woman and Law Project in Southern Africa ( WLSA - Mozambique ) shows that women assume all responsibilities before the children , younger brothers and sisters and the aged .
It is in these family aggregates that one mostly finds absolute poverty .
It is from these aggregates that one can analyze what is generally called the Woman Face of Poverty .
Percentile distribution of management of family aggregates as per place of residence :
Sources : IDS , 1997
The practical forms that assume gender relations in the scope of the family , influence parameters in the behavior of their fertility .
Given to the fact that women do not have any control on their sexuality and reproduction , they redefine maternity as an element of identity that makes them feel women , being a mother , which is translated into high fertility rates .
Between 1980 , 1997 and 2000 the global rate of fertility experienced indexes that range from 6.4 , 5.9 to 5.7 respectively .
Finally , regarding religion , which is considered as an important component on socialization and particularly on ideological participation in building gender relations in the family and society , existing information shows that there is a greater participation of women in each one of the religions existing in the country , except Hinduism .
The aforesaid situation is verified both in rural and in urban zones .
On the other hand , existing studies ( Loforte , 1996 ) show that in the in areas surrounding the city of Maputo Zionism and animist religions reproduce subservience relationships for women who occupy this evangelization position whereas their male counterparts occupy leadership positions .
The problem of disabled women in Mozambique is particularly important , but it is not dissociated from that from those of people for whom disabilities make them a special group , nor from those of the common person who , victimized by the social vicissitudes of poverty , underdevelopment , face all types of social and economic difficult , social pressures , pressures from religious beliefs and , above all , political and traditional pressures to name but a few factors .
A person with disabilities is a victim of a situation of disadvantage , because inequality of opportunities becomes obvious .
Even though the country 's Constitution proclaims equality of rights for all citizens , it suffices to look at small details to realize that lack of facilities necessary to facilitate accessibility in public buildings is a problem that constitutes a dilemma for the disabled .
If the situation is so bleak for a person with disabilities , that of women with disabilities is even worse from the time that they realize that condition and begin to assume their vulnerability and fragility in the attempt to solve their problems as producers , spouses , and mothers with equal rights as other women's .
On the other hand , one knows that as carriers of disabilities , women find other barriers imposed by society , which result in stigmatization , and social exclusion .
In the context of the above , Exclusion puts women exposed to two challenges : as persons with disabilities and unable to compete on equal basis with any other citizens , and as women with certain abnormalities , unable to compete with a disabled male for employment , education , health and other social goods .
Given to the scarcity of studies that report the situation of the disabled women in general , effective characterization of these situations in Mozambique becomes a difficult task .
This means non the existence of elaborate data on the subject .
The most common causes of disability in Mozambique do not differ from those that can be identified in other underdeveloped countries , which , in essence , are related with the condition of poverty .
In this country , added to the reasons of disability are the war factor and its consequences as is the case of personal landmines that remain to maim and kill now that the armed conflict is over .
Following , we have the most common causes of disability among women :
Domestic Violence ;
Infectious Illnesses as the measles and leprosy ;
Alcohol abuse during pregnancy , drug use and forced labor ;
Domestic Accidents , traffic and job - related accidents , and others ;
Food poisoning during pregnancy or in the first months of growth ;
Place of cultural rites such as rites of initiation and genital mutilation in early age ;
Congenital malformation .
The most common forms of deficiency that affect women in this country are : physical disabilities , hearing and speech impairment , blindness , and psychological abnormalities .
In Southern Africa , it is not always possible or easy to find information reflecting the true image of people with disabilities , and Mozambique is not an exception .
The World Health Organization estimates that 10 % of the population of underdeveloped countries has one form of disability or another .
Regarding the characterization of women with disabilities , existing studies are still rather limited .
But in a research study of 18 deaf women in the city of Maputo , in 1999 and in the context of the Sign Languages Program of the Ministry for the Coordination of Social Welfare at that time , some conclusion were made that do not differ much from those that can be made of women with other disabilities :
The ages of the inquired ones varied from between 18 and 22 years ;
Deaf women came from with no hearing problems and 47 % of these women have children ;
About 50 % of respondents are illiterate and the remaining ones have primary education ;
90 % were unaware of the method of Family Planning and did not know about the need to use condoms .
The biggest problem faced by respondents was obstacles to communication and gender discrimination of gender , and low wages .
The forms of deficiency prevention practiced in Mozambique depend on the social class and the educational level that , consequently , is related to the type of job one holds , buying power , access to health care services and balanced nutrition .
Other aspects include the residential neighborhood , if rural or urban one , and personal beliefs .
There is more prevention of malnutrition in the urban areas . Here , there are more infectious diseases and premature marriages that can contribute for the precocious maternities .
It is also here where there is more supply and demand of health care services .
On the other hand , this situation changes very little when looking at the suburban and surrounding zones where , given to low prevalence of health care services and high poverty levels , local populations suffer from grave malnutrition , with a particular gravity to women and among these , to breast feeding women .
It is also here where women are subjected to long journeys working in factories where there is little prevention .
Besides ignorance , poverty and lack of health services , inhabitants of rural areas suffer from cultural beliefs and traditional ones that lead to practices of initiation rites .
As in most neighboring countries and the world over , in Mozambique the birth of a child with congenital malformation often causes a feeling of guilty and becomes a reason for conflicts in marriages and families , and women become the major targets of accusations .
In the reasons attributed to these situations is infidelity on the part of women , punishment because of their disobedience or infraction of some sort of norm in their social group .
Given to these beliefs , not only women suffer from the neglect of their husbands as they suffer from abandonment , divorce , physical aggression and other types of ill treatments , but do also their offspring who become abandoned and isolated or even hidden .
As a result of this , girls with disabilities are often led to quarantines and are preventing from attending schools , even in cases of situations where the disability is not so severe .
This assertion is substantiated by the number of girls with disabilities ( 43 ) rehabilitated and integrated in the educational system at primary school level , in the rehabilitation program known as known as the “ Basic Community Attendance ” in progress in Mozambique , since 1993 .
This number , 43 , is not significant when analyzed in function of the geographic and temporal space and in terms of the number of children involved in the implementation of the program .
But it becomes significant when looking at the magnitude of the taboos surrounding the education of girls and the deficiency factor as well as at the magnitude of time it takes to change attitudes and perceptions in the community or society .
Both physical and psycho-social rehabilitation services need to be improved both in quality and coverage , to allow greater access of women to them , and for better integration and retraining of women in terms of self - sufficiency and independency in reproductive life .
As an example of this situation , and in order to illustrate social exclusion and stigmatization , there are only 04 Special Education schools in Mozambique , and girls attendance in these school never goes beyond 15 % in each academic term .
There are only two women in senior position in the three organizations dealing with people with physical or other disabilities ( ADEMO , ADEMIMO , ACAMO ) .
These women are : one General Secretary and one Deputy President of a Delegation .
Although there are several dispersed laws dealing with the specific situation of people with disabilities , there is now a specific policy in the country , that deals Persons with Disabilities , and elaborated by the MMCAS .
The objective of this is to be to define intervention rules of both the Government and the Civil Society , with a view to contributing to active participation of people with disabilities , in their communities and in the development of the Mozambican society .
Other objectives of the Policy are to contribute in the definition of sector strategies guaranteeing the integration of people with disabilities in society and the respect of their human rights as defined in the country 's Constitution .
Article 14 : Rural Women
In relation to rights of land use , there are two systems in Mozambique : “ official right ” sanctioned in the Constitution of 1991 and in the Land Law of 1997 and , in parallel , the traditional right constituted by a wide range of rules that govern the customary right to land and property .
This coexistence is contradictory in its base philosophy : contemporary law states that land is an inalienable property of the State , whereas the traditional mores have it that land belongs to the community living in its surrounding and the community 's ancestors .
Concerning the State law , and the Constitution of the Republic , the Law formally establishes that there is equal right before the law , between men and women , in the use of land .
However , studies carried out by the DEMEG - CEA call attention to the fact that , in legal practice ( where in the absence of a new and updated Family Law in function of the constitutional laws , the colonial code is still being applied partially ) ; the rights of women are potentially weakened with marriage , where they presume that the husband owns family assets .
In the specific case of land for the family sector , the law recognizes that a family aggregate as right to land in as far as the use of land is concerned , and that land can be registered only in the name of the head of the household .
If the law in itself does not present formal impediments to the registry of land for a women heads of households , the attitude of public employees , and the fact of the transaction being extremely bureaucratic can constitute important barriers that conspire against the legalization of land rights .
In light of this scenario , the 1997 Land Law creates the principles of land co-ownership in a couple , during the passing of land ownership titles .
At the level of customary mores , access to land is managed by a complex network of social security that is built around marriage , as a basis of alliances among families .
In 1990 , a study on the “ , which signals that in accordance to the customary law , the ability to have hereditary rights to land depends on a variety of situations : age , sex , social status ( proximity in terms of kinship or family ties of first spiritual owners , the first to populate the area .
Belonging to a local community is a condition sine qua-non , even in certain conditions land could be attributed to individuals of another community .
As a community belonging that is distributed in accordance to need of family aggregates , the same study states that it would be incorrect to interpret the founding right as meaning ownership to land as an individual property , because the owner can not use the land indiscriminately , but only with consent based on a family 's needs .
In the traditional systems , the binomial women / land , or either , the relationship between the major land users — women—and their major means of production can de presumed as follows : from puberty , at which time someone ( father , uncle , territorial leader ) attribute such rights to them to cultivate for their livelihood ; after marriage , in Northern Mozambique ( matrilineal system ) men join women in lands attributed to them , whereas in Southern Mozambique ( where the patrilineal system predominates ) women move to their husbands ' property where they receive land for cultivation .
The new couples can inherit land via the women 's relatives , the husband 's or both .
According to studies carried out recently on inheritance rights while marriage still continues , formal land titles do not seem to be relevant .
In patrilineal societies , problems appear in case of divorce or death of a husband , where a woman runs the risk to lose her land and all her belongings in favor of other members of her late husband 's family , even where she has the responsibility to look after her offspring 's and other relatives .
Evidently , and according to the scheme described above , both regarding the official Land Law and to the Customary Law , put those in need of land for use , or who want to continue exercising their rights to use land , too many barriers for land ownership .
The great changes operated in the last few decades , the multiple population movement due to constant wars and natural disasters have been changing social practices in a radical manner .
We can say that both individuals and social groups use all available means to defend their right to land use : when convenient , they use the Official Law the customary law when it offers better guarantees , the legality and continued creativity whenever new situations emerge .
Evidently , in such situations the most powerful individuals or groups have more possibilities to maneuver and , in the process , the most vulnerable groups often come out losers .
Studies conducted in the past few years by the Land Studies Nuclei of the Eduardo Mondlane University ( UEM ) indicate that land conflicts have seen an increase sped up in number and gravity in post-war Mozambique .
There is a great struggle for use of the most fertile land , from the viewpoint of its social - economic potential ( irrigated land , next to the markets , with access to diverse transports or social services , etc. ) .
The 1997 Land Law establishes , as a way to protect the family sector from conflicts , the demarcation of community land in areas where agricultural enclosures and pastures exist , including other social ends such as hunting , firewood , and fruits , with the objective to currently guarantee land ownership for the most vulnerable in face of the entrepreneurial sector in great expansion .
On the other hand , if it is good that a large number of the population that was internally displaced , or those who were living in neighboring countries as refugees , is back to the areas of their origin , alleviating the territorial pressure where there was higher concentration of people , the return to the origin this far has not been a harmonious process .
A study conducted in on agricultural production systems and the social economic situation in 03 of the country 's villages , indicates that land was—as in the past—often attributed to the most influential families , with the relatives of community leaders having larger plots of land .
Now , the social difference among farmers is getting more acute , because the most powerful families are taking advantage of the more vulnerable ones , usually the returnees , whose labor power is rather cheap .
Even where the returnees repossess their land , if they have no livelihood means to carry them on to the next harvest , these will find themselves forced to seek employment in the farms of permanent residents , instead of working their own land .
So , they run the risk to enter a vicious cycle of dependence the next agricultural campaign , should they not count with sufficient labor force .
This situation is found everywhere throughout the country , and nothing shows otherwise .
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development ( MADER ) , in its Agrarian Policy and Strategies , defined as its main objective to guarantee food security , sustainable development , reduction of unemployment and that of the levels of absolute poverty .
To implement these measures or Policies , MADER prepared the Integrated Agricultural Program ( PROAGRI ) in which the management of agricultural lands is a component in addition to others such as agricultural extension , research , etc.
In fact , the PROAGRI 's Agrarian Land Management document , intends to use the following as strategies :
Support to the local communities and cities in subject of agrarian land management in coordination with the extension and the inquiry .
To investigate the adequacy of policies and the legislation , including regulations for the implementation of agrarian policies .
Rural Credit
The Agricultural financial system ( S.F.R. ) is one of the components of the PROAGRI and it has as the chief objective to guarantee the flow of funds to the family sector made up mostly of women .
The credit amount has been on the increase from USD 261.0 million in 1987 to the level of USD 35.0 million in 1995 .
The agricultural sector presently represent 21 % of absorption of the total credit made available to the Mozambican economy .
These scarce credits are , in their majority , applied in the areas of fast returns in commerce of consumable goods or in agricultural commercialization .
The family sector has found difficulties of access to credits , due to lack of earnings and the conditions needed or required by Commercial Banks .
Thus , the agricultural institutions working in rural development , in an attempt to facilitate rural funding , has been creating alternative sources of funding such as : Agricultural and Rural Development Fund ( FFADR ) , Fisheries Development Fund ( FFP ) , Small Industry Development Fund ( FFPI ) , Fund for Agricultural Credit and Rural Development ( CCADR ) , etc .
In addition of the above mentioned funds , there are other sources of rural development funding , namely : projects , Non-Governmental Organizations ( NGO 's ) and the informal sector characterized by interpersonal interactions at the rural level which allow and give incentives to credit initiatives .
In Northern Mozambique , particularly in the province of Nampula , there is a positive experience in this area .
Through help from some NGO , women heads of family households are organizing themselves in groups and have now formed an association named as the Association of Nampula 's Rural Women ( AMRN ) to carry out profit-making activities that might allow them make profits necessary to collect some savings necessary for the creation of a Credit Fund .
In Southern Mozambique , Swiss NGO organization , in partnership with an extension network that operates in some districts of the province of Maputo , has worked with groups of women in the area of credit in species ( seeds , small species and in the fishing area ) , being positive the results obtained , and therefore the reimbursement rate above of 50 % ) .
Still in Southern Mozambique , specifically in Gaza Province , there is an association known as AGROPEM ( Matuba Association of Cattle Herders and Agriculturists ) that carries out agricultural activities in an irrigated land , presently requiring inputs to increase its earnings and the project 's feasibility .
For this reason , the members of the association benefit from credit funded for by UNIFEM when they banded together in Matuba Association .
Regardless of their successes and failures , these projects have been contributing for the improvement of the credit system to grassroots communities .
The rural extension unit was established in 1992 , in the National Directorate of Rural Extension ( DNER ) .
Past efforts in the DNER to reach rural women with extension services were geared toward women 's reproductive role .
The training given was mostly geared to the food conservation ( e.g. : tomato canning , onions and other vegetables and fruits ) and to food warehousing .
Discussions on the type of extension to adopt for women , to start extension services for women .
The majority of extensionists , supervisors , and rural extensionists are male , and this is given to the fact that there are more vacancies for men in vocational training courses than there are for women .
In relation to farmers who had benefited from the extension program , numbers suggest predominance of men in relation to women , which has to do with the higher number of men working as extensionists , as well as the high rate of illiteracy among rural women and cultural concerns of communities .
In this context , emphasis is on rural women still with consciousness of their rights as consecrated in the Convention .
Reference must be made to the fact that at the Governmental level , there are few steps that are aimed at enabling women to have knowledge of their rights .
However , NGO 's exist that have been working with women providing support to rural women the country over , and among these is AMRU .
Rural women have no representation at the level of the Government , and specific programs aimed satisfying the need of this group , which constitutes the country 's majority , do not exist .
Several times , rural women have not had access to health care services , nor counseling on long distance problems that separate them from health care centers .
A problem that needs to be mentioned in the rural area is lack of incentive that allows investment in markets .
Reference should be made to the fact that the Mozambican Government is involved in reforms based —and contained in—its 5 - Year Program ( 1999 - 2004 ) which includes the incorporation of gender problems at the level of the agricultural sector .
In last decades , the Mozambican population has grown to a rhythm sped up by about 3 , 3 % , caused by the formation of a considerable sector of vulnerable population .
Of this contingent , women represent more than 50 % .
The extreme conditions of poverty in which women live both in the urban and in rural zones , constitute the major cause of environmental problems .
Indiscriminate cutting of trees to obtain fuel , mostly in the cities thus provoking deforestation of thousands of hectares of land , leads to scarcity of fuel forcing women to travel long distances looking for this source of energy .
In the last years of 1980's the annual deforestation rate was estimated at 0.8 % and deforestation covered 120 ha , whereas reforestation was only of about 4,000 ha/ year .
Vegetal Fuel and charcoal production was of about 15,022 m³ , which meant a very high consumption of forest resources .
Agricultural activity in Mozambique involves a large portion of the Mozambican active population , and women represent 63 % and work in more sectors , both family and cooperative , and are responsible for food sustenance .
Itinerant agriculture and forest fires concur for the destruction and reduction of biodiversity .
The development of agriculture in hillsides , edges of the rivers and dunes provokes erosion destroying the ground , and reducing land fertility , which harm women the most .
Sanitary aspects constitute the most serious impact of the process of urbanization , with high rates of incidence of infectious and parasitic diseases that caused by lack of water supply and sanitation .
Women are particularly affected because it their responsibility to clean around the house , clean and treat garbage , water transport and child care .
In 1995 the population with access to drinking water was of 33 % and with access to sanitation represented 20 % .
On the other hand , the population without access to drinking water was of 10 , 1 million and without access to sanitation was of 12 , 1 million .
The major salespersons and users of the informal markets are women and therefore , they automatically changed into precursors and victims of the degradation of environmental hygiene .
Industries are responsible for the pollution , which poses a serious threat to ecological balance .
In Mozambique , light industries have mostly women as their major laborers who generally work without any protection ( boots , gloves , dressing gowns , mask , helmets ) to prevent the harmful effects of the residues released by factors .
Prolonged exposure to pollutants by women workers can lead to deterioration of their health condition , particularly the health of pregnant women or those who are breastfeeding .
Natural disasters ( droughts , floods and tropical cyclones ) have been provoking environmental displaced persons , mostly among women who , in turn , exercise an elevated demographic pressure on natural resources where they migrate to .
Provoked the sprouting of dislocated environment , mainly women who , in turn , exert a high demographic pressure on the natural resources in the immigration small farms .
In 1995 , an Environmental Policy was adopted and this constitutes the basis for sustainable development in Mozambique aimed at eradicating poverty , improve quality of life of Mozambicans and reduce damage of the natural environment .
The Environmental Policy gives a special attention to women through attention to programs of management of the natural resources , environment education and other programs that allow women to achieve equality of opportunities .
In July of 1997 , the Legal Framework Law on the Environment was approved by Parliament , and this is aimed at ensuring sustainable development of the country and at giving particular emphasis on the role of women in the management of natural environment .
In 1992 the Department of Gender was created in the Ministry for the Coordination of Environmental Activities , with the objective to integrate the dimension of gender in policies , programs , conventions and activities of the Ministry .
The Department of Género has already carried out some activities concerning the Women and the Environment , namely :
Insertion of gender issues in the activities of several Training Departments , Human resources , Legal , Studies , Planning , and Management of Natural Resources .
Studies on cases of access , use , control and management of natural resources for gender issues in some of the country 's districts .
Construction of 40 improved latrines and 2 wells with the support of the Low Cost Latrines Project and that of the National Water Directorate in the Mandjadjane Village of Salamanga , Matutuíne District , and Maputo Province .
Cleaning of Matola Township 's Promotion drainage ditch , by a group of 150 people mostly women who receive food for work through the World Food Program ( City of Matola ) .
Plantation of fruit and shade trees to combat erosion and help in the production of firewood in Marracuene ( Province of Maputo ) .
Production and distribution of audio-visual materials on gender , Women and Environment , such as the Role of Woman and Environment in the scope of the Festival of Woman , Action and Transformation and in the week of the Environment , production of Magazine “ Life and Woman ” which portrays day - to - day life of women and their relation with the natural resources .
Training Courses on Gender and the Environment for Environmental Agents , extensionists and technicians of some pro-ambient institutions and NGO 's .
At the level of the Civil Society some programs of environmental management have been implemented , and count with the involvement of private companies and NGO 's .
Some of these companies in the field involve the population in the management of natural resources , concretely the flora and the fauna , as it is the case of the management of the animal reserves for the population .
In the Circles of Interest for Women that can be found throughout the country , women give advise on saving of the fuel manufacturing of improved stoves for the so called economic boxes or marvels ; they plant trees , fight erosion through the reforestation and raising of barriers of rocks and woods ( gabions ) ; they build wells for potable drinking water , and manage them through committees of sanitation that generally are co-coordinated by women ; they boil water , they dispose and / or burn garbage .
Some NGO 's as the Mozambican Association for the Rural Development ( ORAM ) ( Agricultural Association for Mutual Aid ) support agriculture through the distribution of seeds , hoes and education on technologies of low cost , but environmentally sustainable Projects , such as plantation of mapira and mexoeira that resists drought and makes agriculture in terraces possible .
PROPECA ( Environmental Education Project ) in the city of Beira , and the Environmental Working Group ( G.T.A. ) make environmental education , inquiry and advisory work on environment .
NGO's are worried with the need to improve environmental conditions of the population through theater , dances , songs etc . This is the case of the “ Sacred Tree ” Dance of the National Dance Company , the theatre piece “ The Day the Earth Stopped Moving ” of the Nkulo group and others .
Article 15 : Equality Before the Law
Although the Constitution states that men and women are equal before the law , married women are not formally treated equally before the Law , concerning their ability to celebrate contracts and manage property , because under the existing Law the husband is considered as the head of the family .
This means that married women can only exercise their rights with the permission of their husbands .
For example , women have no rights to celebrate contracts , including those related to loans , property , as well as commercial transactions in their own name , but may do so only with an explicit consent from their spouses .
When married with communion of goods , the same is applicable to husbands : they can not make any decision without a prior consent from their wives .
The Civil Code , particularly the Family Law that safeguards the ideal of a society based on patrilineal family unity , regulates the marriage .
The Family Law is presently under review as stated previously .
According to customary mores , women have fewer privileges than before the Family Law .
They can appeal before courts only on matters related to their matrimony should their marriage be official or legal .
In accordance with the existing Family Law , a married woman may execute or manage her husband 's property , but only if the latter is disabled or absent , and when the marriage has a prenuptial agreement to this end , or specifying who shall When the husband dies , the widower is fourth in the line ( in relation to the children , parents , brothers ) to inherit the goods .
Although the Law says that the widower is the half owner of the goods acquired during the marriage , in the practical terms a woman rarely knows , or insists on , her rights .
Mozambique has not given giant steps toward the reinforcement of obligations stated under Article 15 ( 3 ) of the Convention that demands that all contracts and other instruments with the view to restricting the legal capacities of women be removed and considered invalid and null .
Formally , women are treated on the basis of equality in the courts . They may swear in their own names and may take their place in the legal system on equal basis with men .
There is an increase in women who are judges and lawyers in Mozambique , and work in the judicial system or in civil courts .
So , generally speaking , the work of courts is stuck due to lack of qualified staff .
Even though legal aid is free for both men and women , there are few women who resort to legal aid , mostly due to social and cultural pressures .
Many women do n't know , nor do they want to know anything about the existing legal aid , mostly due to cultural pressures .
When women resort to courts to solve their problems , they are seldom seen with good eyes .
There are several awareness campaigns to inform women about their needs , and several organizations do frequently offer free legal advise , but they mostly work in urban centers . This limits their efficacy , because the majority of women live in rural centers .
Men and women have the right to the same indemnity in the same circumstances , and the sentences seem to be the same .
Research has , however , revealed some differences between formal and community courts in the administration of justice .
The main difference is that formal courts are based on written laws , while the community courts are based on customary norms .
There are no legal concepts that can be used by women as special cases of defense .
For example , in the case of violence , women who commit an offense to protect themselves against gender - based violence are treated the same way as their male counterparts .
They can only invoke self - defense as special defense , without making reference to violence resulting from gender inequality .
Violation can be judged in courts , but there is no Law that defines domestic violence as a crime .
However , ignorance on equality of rights by women is the major factor of discrimination of women .
Article 16 : Equality in Marriage and Before Family Law
Although the CRM in its article 67 makes use “ men and women are equal before the law ” the existing Family Law which is an integral part of 1966 Civil Code , there still is Law of the effective Family who is integrant part of the Civil Code of 1966 , there are still many factors contributing to discrimination against women , among which we mention the following :
The husband is the Head of the Family .
The woman must adopt , when married , the residence of the husband .
The woman needs the consent of the husband to exert commercial activities
The man is the administrator of community properties , including the private properties of women .
These and other factors are a practical example that before the Family Law , women are discriminated and subordinated to men .
There various commonly accepted ways in Mozambique , to constitute a family , namely :
The traditional marriage ( the so called lobolo in Southern Mozambique ) the religious marriages ( Christian , Muslim , and others ) the civil marriage and the union of fact .
As for the right to freely choose a partner , it can be said that only women have the right to do so .
Sometimes , predominantly in the rural areas , it 's the woman 's family that selects “ the ideal partner ” .
After the marriage , the woman whose husband is selected by her family sometimes sees her rights being violated , and in such cases there is no defense mechanism .
Regarding the responsibilities of the couple following marriage , these are also different , both before the Law and under the Customary Law .
Polygamy is a customary practice commonly accepted in Mozambique , even though it is legally prohibited .
There are no statistical data , because this practice is legally recognized , but we are conscious that in rural areas this practice abounds . And we also know that the second , third and even fourth woman has no legal rights and protection whatsoever .
Concerning unions of fact , those involved are mutually bound to each other 's commitments of official marriages , and once cohabitation ceases to exist , produces effects in what concerns minor children .
Regarding the custody of minor children , it matters to make reference to the fact that both parents ( married or not ) have the responsibility to provide for their sustenance , education , and clothing .
This obligation exists even when the couple had never been married and continues for a long time , or even beyond marriage .
On the custody of the minor children , this also depends on specific circumstances of each case .
However , when dealing with children aged 0 to 6 years , their mother normally decides their custody , with the father being obliged to provide the food necessary for their sustenance .
The attribution of custody does not depend on the marital status of the parents .
As for making of decisions that might affect the children , which constitutes an aspect of the exercise of the paternal power , we can say that normally decisions regarding the younger child or children are taken commonly , by both parents , in spite of the fact that the Family Law gives more rights to the father than to mother .
When the parents do not live together , the parent who caters for the child makes most of the decisions .
Regarding the administration of the couple 's assets , Law will hand this over to the husband , except where there exists a separation of goods regimen .
In this case , each parent both spouses have the right to acquire , exactly without the consent of the other , good for the couple .
However , the disposal of goods , free of charge , depends in some circumstances on the consent of both spouses .
Always let us have in mind that , before the Law , man is the head of family , and the administrator of the common assets .
Dissolved the marriage , by divorce or death , the part of the conjugal assets is done in accordance with the regimen of goods obtained during marriage .
Therefore , being the regimen one of communion good , each one of the spouses has right to half of the said property or assets .
When the marriage is dissolved through a litigious divorce , only the not guilty spouse can ask for food .
This means that if the woman is declared guilty in the divorce , even in case of need she can not ask her husband for foodstuffs .
However , when the divorce is based on mutual agreement it is up to the two spouses to decide who will have or not , right to food installment and the respective amount .
Concerning the reasons justifying divorce , these are stated in Article 1778 of the Civil Code , and among them is adultery , abandonment of the family home and any other facts that establish the physical or moral integrity of the petitioning spouse .
Both for women working in agriculture and for those house - makers , there is a need to follow or abide with , these rules .
But the partition of goods obeys the criteria of who between the two spouses has contributed the most in the accumulation of joint assets .
Regarding family planning , there is a national health program known as the Mother - Child Program ( SMI ) , which provides information and health care services to women in fertile age , as well as to the newborns .
In the context of that program , women receive information on the existing anti-contraceptive methods and family planning , so that they may be able to decide on how to space their children .
However , the program does not cover the entire country yet , in that there are still too many women , particularly in the countryside , who do not have the freedom to make decisions on their sexuality , nor on the spacing of their children .
The majority of these women are subject to traditional and cultural constraints .
So , it goes without saying that in most households that decision rests with men—they decide how many children their wives should have and when .
The husband determines the family name .
However , should a given couple have sons , their names will have to be constituted by the parental last names followed by the maternal ones .
But in the majority of families , the children receive their father 's last name .
In Mozambique , the age of majority is reached at 21 , for both men and women .
But Law determines the minimum ages for marriage .
So , the girl may get married at age 14 , whereas boys get married with 16 years .
These ages are consequently the minimum allowed to have sex as a married couple .
There is no exception as to the minimum age of marriage .
But on average , girls get married with 20 - 24 years and boys 24 - 30 years of age .
Sexual practice with minors can constitute a criminal offense leading to conviction .
However , in many areas of our country , there are recurrent traditional marriages involving adults with girls aged less than 12 years , and these subsequently enter into precocious sexual activity , without any sanctioning to the perpetrators .
Traditionally , the payment of “ a price for the bride ” is usually paid and this is known as the lobolo .
This practice is openly accepted , but it is not considered by Law , so , legally it does not produce any effects in marriage .
But lobolo is one of the major factors leading to discrimination of women in marriage , because it 's under lobolo that some husbands state that they have the full custody of their wives because they have paid lobolo for them .
It 's under lobolo that most women are openly abused .
Concerning inheritance , traditionally women have no right to inheritance .
Even though the Law protects women on this matter , they never benefit from such protection , because in practice women benefit from inherited assets only if there is no older child or if no living relatives of the deceased exist .
So , she really never comes to benefit from her husbands inherited assets .
However , given the existence of certain traditional practices , some women in certain regions of Mozambique are purified following their husbands ' death .
Regarding the widowed men , when subjected to these rites they are less heavy .
Social study of widowed males differs from that of female widows .
Family Law
Mozambique still does not have a Family Law .
All matters having to do with Family Law can be found in Book IV — Articles 1576 to 2023 of the 1967 Portuguese Family Law , and in Law 8/92 of May 06 , 1992 which introduces non-litigious divorce .
The principle of the supremacy of the husband as the head of the household is consecrated in “ our ” Family law ( C.C. Article 1674 ) .
From this departure , it is obvious that the role of women is always subordinate .
That is why she is obliged to move to her husband 's household ( article 1672 of the C.C. ) , and the administration of the couple 's assets , including women 's private property is , by rule , attributed to the husband ( article 1678 nº1 of the C.C. ) who is not obliged to be accountable on their administration .
Concerning marriage dissolution via divorce , and particularly concerning divorce through mutual agreement , apparently the same rules apply both for men and for women .
Looking at what comes in Article 5 of Law 8/92 of May 06 , 1992 , it becomes obvious that in the concession of a litigious divorce , the couples must agree on :
The regulation of the paternal power regarding minor children ;
The allotment of common assets ;
Provision of foodstuffs to the less privileged spouse ;
Destination of what used to be the couple 's home .
It is in the application of this legal practice that through divorce , women become in a less privileged position in comparison with their male counterparts .
In more than half of existing litigious divorces , the paternal authority in regard to minor children is attributed to mothers , and fathers undertake the responsibility too provide a food pension to the minor children , and the amount of this is expected to be that able to satisfy their livelihood needs .
Regarding paternal power , the law gives right to both parents , but it distinguishes between those given to fathers and those to mothers ( Article 1879 , 1881 and 1882 of the CC ) .
If one is to analyze the aforesaid legal dispositions , it is concluded that women are discriminated , even though in most families it 's quite clear that it is women who take care of the children , look after them and even after their education .
In face of Article 1881 of the C.C. , the responsibilities of fathers as heads of families are :
To Provide for the sustenance , education and instruction of the minor ;
To emancipate him / her ;
To defend him / her and to represent him / her , including the unborn ;
To authorize him / her to practice certain acts , that depend on the consent of both parents ;
To authorize him / her to exert a profession , art or craft , and to live independently , and :
To manage his / her goods .
Concerning the mother , she has only to be consulted on all matters related to her child or children and must insure the physical , moral and mental integrity of the minor children .
Therefore , fathers , who have full legal coverage for this , take all - important decisions regarding the life of the child or children .
Inheritance Rights
Inheritance Rights are a set of legal rules that deal with the regimen of transmission of assets of single individuals , or either , a set of rules regulating how the assets that belonged to a deceased person should be transmitted to third parties .
Inheritance Rights existing in Mozambique also a legacy from the Portuguese system are being presently changed .
Given the rules contained in Book V of the Civil Law , one can not say , simply , that there discriminating rules in relation to women , and this because we are dealing with a Law that questions if the successor , or the would be beneficiaries are male or female .
The problem emerges in practice .
In fact , given various inherited cultural values via customary law , and due to the existence in Mozambique of several ethnic groups with different traditions , and because of total lack of knowledge of existing law , the application of existing Inheritance Rights becomes problematic .
In order to better understand the origin of the problem of practical application of written law , it is necessary to know what the customary law says on the subject matter .
There are basically systems of Inheritance , based on matrilineal and matrilineal families .
In the matrilineal system , when the husband dies , the widower can be obliged to remain in the late husbands nuclear family with her children , having right to benefit from the inheritance .
However , the right to property or inheritance of the assets of the decease goes automatically to the first - born son in the family and , it is his responsibility to share these with his younger brother if he chooses to do so .
There are , however , patrilineal systems where all sons share inheritance rights , with the first - born having the bigger share .
It should be mentioned here that in any case , the female widow does not receive any inheritance rights , and this leaves her without any rights to access of the goods left by her late husband .
Concerning the matrilineal system , in case of death of a husband , the beneficiary becomes the first - born nephew / sister 's son or the deceased 's older cousin .
The woman inherits the hut and all domestic utensils thereof .
Despite the common norms being used currently , most recently there have been situations that are far from being compatible with customary law .
Most of these behaviors come from the husband 's family that , whenever there are valuable goods , insists on repossessing them thus leaving the widowed woman and her children without anything whatsoever .
Situation of Women in Marital Relationships
Before approaching other areas of Law in which women are discriminated , there is a need to analyze the situation of married women , because the existing Law does not contemplate this .
Through the Draft Family Law , implemented through Decree 01/82 of 27 of February of 1982 of the Supreme Court , attempts were made to give legal coverage to the dissolution of marital union , due to the personal and assets problems that emerged at that time .
Although with some virtues , the said project sinned by comparing factual union to marriage in all of its facets .
Today , women living in factual union or common - law married do not have any legal coverage , and their situation is analyzed by Courts only where assets are concerned and in the regulation of paternal power .
This happens when such a union ends .
During the common law marriage , women keep their marital status to that of single and for this reason they are not forced to the name of her male counterpart nor does she have to live in his home .
Regarding assets , and because there are no common assets here , all that exists is property belonging to women , which they can dispose off at their whim .
Major problems exist when the husband dies during this union .
In these cases , the woman does not inherit anything , and has no inheritance rights even where she has contributed toward the purchase of such assets .

Agenda
Women and peace and security
Report of the Secretary - General on women and peace and security ( S /2005/636 )
The meeting resumed at 3.20 p.m.
The President : I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Israel , in which he requests to be invited to participate in the consideration of the item on the Council 's agenda .
In conformity with the usual practice , I propose , with the consent of the Council , to invite that representative to participate in the discussion , without the right to vote , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council 's provisional rules of procedure .
There being no objection , it is so decided .
At the invitation of the President , the representative of Israel took the seat reserved for him at the side of the Council Chamber .
The President : In accordance with the understanding reached among Council members , I wish to remind to all speakers to limit their statements to no more than five minutes so as to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously .
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber .
I would also like to reiterate that in order to optimize the use of our time I will not individually invite speakers to take seats at the Council table .
When a speaker takes the floor the Conference Officer will seat the next speaker on the list at the table .
I thank you for your understanding and cooperation .
Mr. Rogachev ( Russian Federation ) ( spoke in Russian ) : In the five years since the adoption of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , we have managed to accomplish a great deal .
We note with satisfaction that the range of issues under discussion today are being given greater attention not only in the Security Council , but also within the framework of the General Assembly , the Economic and Social Council and its functional commissions , particularly the Commission on the Status of Women .
The process of gender mainstreaming is being pursued in all aspects of United Nations activities .
Useful recommendations in this area were made by the High - level Panel on Threats , Challenges and Change ( A/59/565 ) and in the report of the Secretary - General entitled “ In larger freedom : towards development , security and human rights for all ” ( A/59/2005 ) .
Nevertheless , there is still much to be done .
A particularly difficult situation continues to prevail on the African continent , where the status of women has become dramatic in some cases .
That shows that we need to make even greater efforts to achieve the full implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
We have scarcely exhausted the resolution 's potential as an important guide in defining the roles of women in conflict prevention and settlement and in post-conflict reconstruction .
That is made particularly clear by States ' commitment to the full and effective implementation of the resolution , as reaffirmed in the outcome document ( resolution 60 / 1 ) of the 2005 summit .
In a so - called era of fulfilling commitments , we need to make practical use of the resolution 's provisions by establishing equal opportunity for active participation by women in all efforts to maintain and promote peace and security and by enhancing women 's role in decision - making .
We believe that , in the near future , gender perspectives must be given their appropriate place in the activities of the Peacebuilding Commission , whose mandate should be elaborated with a view to the implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
On the whole , the centre of activities in this area should be shifted from the Security Council to specific everyday situations in international life .
Of course , reliable results will be achieved only in the context of naturally developing processes .
A good basis for mobilizing the efforts of United Nations agencies is being established through the system - wide action plan for the implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , set out in the report of the Secretary - General ( S /2005/636 ) .
We welcome the plan 's detailed identification of concrete activities that will enable us to focus the Organization 's activities on implementing a system - wide strategy for dealing with problems in the area of women and peace and security .
We note the opportunities that the plan provides for strengthening inter-agency coordination and structural accountability .
In that connection , it is important that gender mainstreaming in the field not be merely a declared intention , but rather that it produce concrete results that protect and enhance the situation of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict situations .
We also welcome the intention of the Secretary - General , as reflected in his report on the implementation of the summit outcome , to ensure policies of zero tolerance with regard to sexual exploitation by United Nations personnel .
Bearing in mind that women are able to play and are already playing a greater role in all aspects of conflict prevention and settlement , we support the elaboration of a strategy to ensure full participation by women in peace negotiations and in elections .
In the context of post-conflict reconstruction , we must make greater use of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women as an essential document .
Moreover , we should devote greater attention to gender mainstreaming in the work of United Nations programmes and funds aimed at overcoming poverty in post-conflict situations .
We are thinking in particular of strategies for enhancing women 's participation in decision - making on social and economic issues and in the establishment of national frameworks for achieving the Millennium Development Goals .
In conclusion , I should like to reaffirm our conviction that the issue of women 's participation in peace processes will receive comprehensive and priority consideration in the bodies of the United Nations system .
Ms. Banzon ( Philippines ) : First , permit me to join previous speakers in thanking the Government of Romania for convening this important open debate .
Through you , Mr. President , I should also to thank our speakers today for their comprehensive presentations .
The short video presentation showed us the multiplier effect that results from the protection and empowerment of women as active agents of peace and as effective peacebuilders .
Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) is not merely a resolution ; it is a movement wherein women 's participation in securing peace has been acknowledged as a critical factor of success in conflict prevention and resolution .
There is still a huge gap when it comes to making women part of peacebuilding in the public and official sense .
We need to make the flesh and spirit of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) tangible on the ground .
In the Philippines , the gender dimension of conflict is being addressed , particularly in peace negotiations and in peace and development efforts .
To ensure that the voices of women are heard , the Government 's peace panels included two women in the core negotiating team .
In the southern part of the country , the Mindanao Commission on Women has formulated a Mindanao women 's position paper on the peace agreement between the Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front .
Recently , women leaders in Mindanao have been pursuing projects to empower the women of southern Philippines to be channels for respect for cultural diversity and for the building of a more inclusive Mindanao society .
The Philippines framework for dealing with the issue of women and conflict covers three areas : first , ensuring the protection of women 's human rights by addressing violence against women , by providing health services and by promoting human rights education ; secondly , promoting economic empowerment by urgently addressing the lack of access to water , electricity and other basic needs , as well as by stimulating economic opportunities for women ; and thirdly , fostering effective governance by promoting awareness of gender and peace concerns among local Government units and by improving women 's participation in decision - making processes .
In short , our fundamental strategy for implementing resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) lies in enabling more women to systematically participate in conflict prevention , management and resolution and in post-conflict peacebuilding , while at the same time rehabilitating their communities and ensuring basic services and livelihoods .
The Philippines ensures the full participation of women in local peace processes by building capacities and mobilizing peace constituencies .
For example , women in indigenous communities are serving as intermediaries in local peace dialogues and as mediators in the restoration of broken peace pacts .
They are also engaged in mobilizing community participation in the formulation of ancestral - domain development plans and reconciliation processes .
We would also like to add that the Philippines is particularly encouraged to note the findings of a recent national survey on the Filipino people 's perception of women as peacemakers .
A principal finding of the survey is that a majority of Filipinos agree with the statement “ A successful peace process in Mindanao needs the participation of women along with me n ” .
The same statistical study also shows that both Filipino men and women nationwide share the same strong advocacy of women 's representation in Government peace panels .
Also interesting is the conclusion that over half of the nationwide sample agrees that a woman has more talent than a man for finding a way to settle a conflict without resorting to violence .
The Philippines welcomes the establishment of a United Nations system - wide action plan to implement resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , which has been explained comprehensively by Ms. Mayanja .
We note that many of the components of that action plan are not entirely new and have already been operational for some time .
What is new about the plan , however , is the orchestration of all the actions towards realizing 1325 ( 2000 ) .
The action plan is valuable not only in providing a coherent picture of our efforts to achieve the resolution 's goals , but also in pinpointing areas that we might have missed and functions that could be overlapping .
The system - wide action plan would therefore contribute much to the efficiency and accountability of the United Nations system on gender mainstreaming in the field of peace and conflict resolution .
The Philippines believes that the system - wide action plan is but a means to an end .
Member States , led by Security Council members , must be conscious of the critical transition from the gains of gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping missions to the achievement of sustainable capacities at the local level .
The action plan must therefore function as a vehicle to transplant investments in gender mainstreaming long after the peace missions have dissolved .
It would therefore be important for the United Nations field presence to be in close contact with national and local authorities , as well as with local non-governmental organizations , to ensure that gender mainstreaming successes filter through to the most basic governance and civil structures .
In that regard , we were happy to hear Mr. Guéhenno report that gender units in peacekeeping operations have been supporting the capacity development of national counterparts in Government and non-governmental sectors .
As developments on the ground continue to be fluid , the Philippines would like to see the action plan used also as a tool for gathering accurate information on the status of women in conflict areas , including the scope and gravity of gender - based violence and progress on the empowerment of women in the area of peace and security .
Certainly , that information would serve to guide the Council on the way forward in implementation and monitoring .
The action plan should also remain responsive to changes in the environment and should be updated , as necessary .
In conclusion , the Philippines looks forward to the establishment of the proposed peacebuilding commission ; resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) should be among the basic pillars of its work .
Essential to the work of the peacebuilding commission would be its coordination with civil society , including women 's organizations , both at the Headquarters level and at the country level .
The current state of the restructuring and rationalizing of the organization and work of the United Nations presents a rare opportunity to boost the work of mainstreaming gender in peace efforts .
The Philippines will continue to contribute to the work of strengthening the gender perspective in all stages of the peacebuilding process .
The President : I should now like to make a statement in my national capacity .
I should indicate from the outset that Romania fully aligns itself with the statement that was made this morning by the British Ambassador on behalf of the European Union .
Within the United Nations system and elsewhere , there is growing international consensus that women 's participation in conflict prevention and peace processes is a matter of having a solid understanding of and healthy perspective on the issue .
We are told and we say that the role of women in decision - making is important and legitimate , serves the cause of peace , and fosters reconstruction and reconciliation .
It is generally argued that women 's empowerment would ensure that those who are frequently the most vulnerable play a role in the transformation and rebuilding of their societies .
That is an assumption that needs challenging .
Women should be acknowledged as having a valuable contribution to make to their societies and to international relations not because of their high potential as victims , but because they are recognized as valuable and skilful resources , able to make a difference and bring added value to peace processes in all parts of the world .
Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) marked , in our view , our acceptance and endorsement of a different mindset about women in peace and security .
We often predetermine policies and decisions , categorizing women as vulnerable beings and identifying them primarily as likely victims .
Resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , however , recognizes the true dimension of women 's capabilities to contribute to and to be equal partners with men in peace processes and to contribute substantially to the development of their societies .
We have vivid illustrations of those facts .
Women fight wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , contribute to post-conflict reconstruction in Kosovo and Bosnia , are excellent peacekeepers in Africa , act as devoted parliamentarians , and make decisions in governmental structures in Rwanda , Uganda and Eritrea .
From the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) onwards , this Council — and the entire United Nations system , we should like to believe — have acted towards and given support to a wider and more balanced presence of women in peace and security .
The participation of women in conflict prevention and resolution is no longer narrowly defined as a matter of gender equality and no longer confined to a perspective of human rights , democratic practices or social justice .
It is a matter of a whole new mentality acknowledging that women embody political representation at all levels and in all societies and have the necessary knowledge , expertise and resources to participate in the advancement of their societies through their active contributions to disarmament , demobilization and reintegration processes .
At this point , we wish to stress our view that the role of women as agents of development and peace should transcend boundaries and cultures .
Engaging women in national and international affairs does not mean changing one 's particular system of values .
It is within the richness of each particular system that gender perspectives should be sought , put in the spotlight and mainstreamed into politics and policies .
States , the United Nations , regional organizations and non-governmental organizations must work together in order to close the gap that still exists between discourse and the diplomatic perspective , on the one hand , and the reality on the ground , on the other .
A starting point in that direction is the recent report of the Secretary - General on women , peace and security , particularly the system - wide action plan for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
We express our appreciation to the Secretariat for such a unique and complex work , which we believe is a useful tool and framework of action for gender mainstreaming in all activities being carried out by the United Nations system .
The continued implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) calls for ongoing scrutiny at the national and international levels of all forms of violence against and abuse of women in conflict or post-conflict situations by combatants or United Nations peacekeeping personnel , as well as of trafficking in human beings , women refugees and internally displaced persons .
In Romania , with the valuable help and support of the United Nations Population Fund , this October organized an international conference on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
The conference in Bucharest brought together participants from Sierra Leone , Afghanistan , Zambia , Palestine , Timor - Leste , Thailand , the Sudan and Kosovo .
They discussed the value of the resolution and how to move forward , share experiences and methodologies for its implementation and , most important , how to narrow the gap between the text 's provisions and reality on the ground .
It is indeed true that , even when women are guaranteed their civil and political rights by a network of institutions and norms , legal stipulations , even when just and unambiguous , can not by themselves ensure gender equity in the diversity of social and political life .
Empowering women is about overcoming prejudice and marginalization and marshalling political will to recognize them as resourceful contributors to decision - making .
It is Romania 's position that we should all shift our approach to women and peace and security to one that views their participation as the rule rather than the exception .
We should also move from words to action and , last but not least , treat women as full partners rather than as a special category .
I now resume my functions as President of the Council .
I now give the floor to Ms. Elsie - Bernadette Onubogu , Gender Adviser of the Commonwealth Secretariat .
Ms. Onubogu : I would like to congratulate the delegation of Romania on its assumption of the presidency of the Security Council .
I should also like to express our gratitude for the holding of this meeting and for the opportunity to address the Council .
I would also like to extend to the Council the greetings of to The Right Honourable Don McKinnon , Commonwealth Secretary - General .
Since 2000 , the Commonwealth has been working with member countries to implement the historic resolution 1235 ( 2000 ) , particularly by strengthening its programme of work on gender , democracy , peace and conflict through the Commonwealth 's new Plan of Action for Gender Equality 2005 - 2015 .
The Commonwealth 's 53 member States straddle nearly every continent in seeking to promote peace , strong democracies , good governance , gender equality and sustainable development .
Within those fundamental values , the Commonwealth 's comparative advantage lies in upholding democracy and developing and encouraging a stronger democratic culture within member countries , as evidence has shown that countries with strong democracies are less likely to experience conflict .
In that connection , Mr. McKinnon has noted that
“ when women and men are enabled to play their full part in the future of their country , when there is real debate about issues of collective concern — about education , health care , employment , governance , social justice — extremist and violent ideologies are less likely to hold sway ” .
Broadly speaking , the Commonwealth has a five - pronged approach to conflict prevention , conflict management and peacebuilding .
It includes the following elements .
The first relates to strengthening democracies .
The Commonwealth works with member States to build the necessary capacity for democratic elections and governance systems and to ensure that member countries seek to achieve representative democracies that include women , men , young persons and politically marginalized groups .
The Secretary - General of the Commonwealth appoints election observers and monitors to support elections in member States .
They report on the conduct of elections in countries such as Cameroon , Papua New Guinea , Malawi , Nigeria , Pakistan , Sri Lanka , Tanzania and a number of others .
In the Commonwealth we reaffirm our conviction that gender equality is a fundamental premise in achieving representative democracy .
The second element is increased participation and representation of women at all levels .
Commonwealth ministers for women and gender affairs have adopted a new Plan of Action for Gender Equality .
In the Plan of Action the ministers recalled the 1991 Harare Declaration , which was adopted by Commonwealth heads of Government and urged member States to promote gender equality as a fundamental principle of democracy , good governance and peace both within the Commonwealth and throughout the world .
In furtherance of those objectives , efforts are under way to establish a regional leadership training institute for Caribbean women in politics , an undertaking that was the result of a workshop organized by the Commonwealth secretariat and other partners .
It is envisaged that such initiatives will promote women 's increased participation and representation in decision - making at all levels .
Women 's representation and participation is critical because , for women to be able to influence policies and decisions that affect their lives and those of their societies , especially in conflict and post-conflict situations , their political , social , cultural and economic empowerment through access to decision - making must form part of the democratic ideal .
To further promote women 's representation , the Commonwealth Secretary - General regularly appoints special envoys to countries to monitor developments in member States that are likely to result in conflict .
Such envoys work with member countries to carry out dialogue and prevent conflicts before they occur .
Some women envoys have been appointed in that regard , to countries such as Cameroon . However , there is room for more participation by women .
The third element relates to developing a culture of peace through peace education .
Along with other partners , the Commonwealth is actively engaged in the development of peace education curriculums especially aimed at young persons , in countries such as Sierra Leone , Sri Lanka and Uganda .
The fourth is documentation and information - sharing and good practices .
As part of our continuing effort to provide information and document good practices , the Commonwealth has published a new book entitled Gender Mainstreaming in Conflict Transformation : Building Sustainable Peace .
The book is a body of advocacy , capacity - building and policy tools that is intended to contribute to the why and how of implementing resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) and to peacebuilding throughout the world .
The fifth element concerns partnerships .
In recognition of the need for collective action , the outcome document of the Millennium Summit ( General Assembly resolution 55 / 2 ) outlined the responsibility to protect .
It thus called on Member States and the international community to ensure the protection of civilians , in particular women and children , in conflict and post-conflict environments .
Along with our strong constituents at the country level , we are working in collaboration with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and member Governments to address some of the challenges highlighted in resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) related to enhancing gender awareness on the part of troops .
In conclusion , the Commonwealth recognizes that sustainable peace , gender equality and development are mutually reinforcing and can only be achieved when women and men adhere to the principles of representative democracy , which allow for dialogue and collective action from all citizens and address their concerns .
Five years on , our collective responsibility to protect , as highlighted by the outcome document , must not be ignored .
We must take all necessary steps to effectively address the challenges of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , in particular as regards the protection of the rights of women and children and their participation and representation in all phases of conflict , including prevention , resolution , peacekeeping , reconstruction and peacebuilding .
Only when women 's concerns and contributions are integrated into those processes will we truly give meaning to that landmark resolution .
The President : I now give the floor to the representative of Sweden .
Mr. Lidén : The United Nations system has undertaken commendable efforts in developing a comprehensive action plan to implement Security Council 1325 ( 2000 ) .
But Member States also have a responsibility .
That was stressed in the statement made this morning by the representative of the United Kingdom on behalf of the European Union ( EU ) .
Sweden fully aligns itself with that statement .
Let me just touch upon three additional aspects of that responsibility .
First and foremost , we have a responsibility as Members of the United Nations .
As such , we need to deliver on our commitments and promises .
We must both contribute more women to peace operations and reinforce the preparedness and awareness of our contingents , staff and experts .
We have to demonstrate in the strongest possible ways that sexual exploitation and abuse are completely unacceptable .
And when faced with a report without a gender equality perspective , we should ask for additional information .
To meet some of those challenges , the Swedish partnership project Genderforce has been initiated .
Bringing together relevant Government agencies and organizations , that multi-annual project focuses on integrating resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) into all phases of a peace operation .
Secondly , we have a responsibility as members of regional organizations .
As their role in peace operations increases , so should their responsibilities .
The representative of the United Kingdom has told us what the EU and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) are doing to live up to their responsibilities .
We are pleased to have contributed to that .
But more action is needed , including more sharing of experiences and good practices among regional organizations .
Thirdly , we have a responsibility ourselves to provide ideas and good practices , not only to ask for reports and proposals from others .
A number of gaps are identified in the report of the Secretary - General ( S /2005/636 ) .
I would like to share a few ideas on how some of them could potentially be addressed .
First , threats to women 's security prevent women from being actors .
In August this year , the Swedish Government , together with the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the International Law Association consortium hosted a gender justice partners meeting .
The report of that meeting has been circulated as a United Nations document .
It contains practical recommendations on how to integrate a gender equality perspective in post-conflict societies and thus to enhance the security and participation of women .
We are committed to following up that process , in cooperation with the Republic of South Africa .
Secondly , both the participation and protection of women would benefit from a Peacebuilding Commission with a clear and integrated gender perspective .
The Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs , together with 14 colleagues , has presented the Secretary - General and the President of the General Assembly with specific ideas on how to integrate a gender - equality perspective in the design and work of the Commission and its support offices .
That continues to be a priority for Sweden and for the European Union .
Thirdly , based on its own experience in the field , and in order to meet the changing demands of multifunctional peace operations , Sweden has put forward the idea of civilian observers .
In the transitional phase of a mission — when , for instance , expertise in areas such as elections and human rights is needed — civilian personnel could be phased into military observer teams .
Additional competences could be incorporated , and the mission would thus be genuinely multifunctional at the field level as well .
Such a new category of seconded civilian personnel could significantly increase the number of female mission members at the field level , where military observer teams very often constitute the only presence of a peace mission .
Fourthly , special representatives , special envoys and other emissaries involved in peace negotiations should have firm guidelines from the Secretary - General to enhance women 's participation in peace processes and transitional structures .
Any reason for failure to succeed should be reported on .
Such benchmarks could really make a difference . We need only compare the impressive level of female participation in the parliament of Afghanistan with the much poorer results in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
That does not reflect local conditions . Rather , it is the result of a determined policy on the part of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the Special Representative of the Secretary - General for Afghanistan .
In order to shoulder our responsibilities at the national level , an inter-ministerial working group is now finalizing a Swedish action plan in order to intensify our implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
Work is being — and will continue to be — carried out in cooperation with Government agencies , as well as with civil society .
We look forward to sharing good practices with States and organizations in the process of developing or implementing their plans , methods and tools .
Only by cooperating will we be able to ensure that decisions and ambitions will improve the daily lives of women and men , girls and boys .
We can not afford to settle for less .
Mrs. Asmady ( Indonesia ) : Let me begin by expressing my delegation 's appreciation to the Secretary - General for his efforts to establish a system - wide action plan for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , as set out in his report on women and peace and security ( S /2005/636 ) .
Not only will the report ensure better coordination and the provision of more efficient support to Member States and other actors in implementing the resolution at the national and regional levels , but it will also strengthen the commitment and accountability of the United Nations at the highest level .
Indonesia agrees that it is important — as underlined in the 2005 World Summit Outcome — to integrate a gender perspective into all efforts to maintain and promote peace and security and to ensure equal opportunities for women to be fully involved in peace processes , as well as to increase their role in decision - making at all levels .
In Indonesia , the entry into force of Law No. 12 of 2003 on general elections provides a solid foundation for women 's participation in the decision - making process .
The law seeks to guarantee that women make up at least 30 per cent of those individuals contesting national and regional parliamentary elections .
In doing so , it creates an awareness of gender equality in power and decision - making .
As a major contributor to United Nations peacekeeping missions , Indonesia is of the view that training , gender - sensitization and capacity - building for uniformed personnel and civilian police are essential for effective United Nations peacemaking , peacebuilding and peacekeeping missions .
Law No. 3 of 2002 reaffirmed the need for a new peace paradigm which will inculcate in the Indonesian army a deep commitment to democracy , human rights and the protection of the environment .
Those principles have become an integral part of the basic curriculums of military schools and other military training activities .
My delegation strongly believes that , together with the 12 areas of action , gender mainstreaming must have an impact , at all levels , on those responsible for the implementation of the action plan .
Indonesia therefore fully agrees that there is a need to strengthen the commitment of senior and top managers to institutionalize gender mainstreaming by means of developing effective monitoring , reporting and accountability mechanisms .
In this connection , Indonesia welcomes the efforts of the United Nations specialized agencies that have put in place improved accountability systems to ensure that senior management and staff at all levels undertake efforts to achieve gender mainstreaming in their work .
In order to facilitate implementation , there should be increased efforts to address serious persistent challenges , including overlapping activities ; underdeveloped monitoring , reporting and accountability mechanisms ; the inadequate utilization of gender specialists ; and insufficient capacity for gender analysis .
It is my delegation 's fervent hope that the action plan will be used as a tool for better coordination and the enhancing of synergies within the United Nations system , so that such challenges can be properly addressed as soon as possible .
Indonesia also agrees with the Secretary - General 's recommendation to enhance inter-agency cooperation in the field , including through United Nations country teams , gender theme groups and gender advisers and units and to improve cooperation with national Governments , national machineries for the advancement of women and the promotion of gender equality , and civil society .
However , such efforts should focus on the capacity - building of national machinery , particularly in the area of raising awareness for gender mainstreaming and equality through training , advocacy and socialization , targeting various executive and legislative authorities .
In conclusion , Indonesia is of the view that establishing time lines for the action plan will improve the accuracy of and coordination among concerned United Nations agencies , as well as leading to the enhancement of accountability .
It is Indonesia 's keen hope that significant progress towards the effective implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) will be achieved beyond 2007 and that women will be able to live more secure and productive lives and fully enjoy their human rights and fundamental freedoms .
The President : I give the floor to Mr. Anders B. Johnsson , Secretary General of the Inter - Parliamentary Union .
Mr. Johnsson : I would like to thank you , Mr. President , for having given the Inter - Parliamentary Union the opportunity to address the Security Council on this very important issue .
Before making my statement , I would like to convey to the Council the greetings of Mr. Pier Ferdinando Casini , Speaker of the Italian Chamber of Deputies , who has just been elected President of our organization for a three - year term and who will be coming to New York early next week for the annual parliamentary hearing at the United Nations .
Women and children suffer the most severe consequences of conflicts that they themselves do not instigate .
All of us , therefore , have a responsibility to work in support of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
At a recent IPU Assembly , members of parliament reviewed the situation and drew up an impressive list of actions that they can and do promote in parliaments and elsewhere in support of that resolution .
Fittingly , the IPU — as the world organization of parliaments — addresses the issue of women 's participation in peace processes from a parliamentary perspective .
Parliaments have a fundamental role to play in peace and reconciliation processes and in the implementation of peace agreements .
The very existence of a strong and effective parliament is itself an essential component of any solution to conflict and in the building of peace .
Women must be full and equal participants in political processes .
This is not only a question of rights — of equality in society — but also an issue of substance .
Surveys we have undertaken clearly demonstrate the fact that many women have a keen awareness of social issues that many men lack .
They have a better understanding of specific gender issues , particularly violations of the rights of women during conflict , which need to be addressed in peace processes .
Hence , these peace processes can be truly effective and efficient only to the extent that both women and men participate in them .
Yet this is certainly not the case today .
In parliaments , for example , women make up only , on average , 16 per cent of the membership .
It is therefore encouraging that the presence of women members in parliament in many post-conflict countries has shown a tendency to increase markedly after the conflict , invariably resulting in figures for women members of parliament that are well above the world average .
The majority of those countries rank among the top 30 in the world .
Rwanda 's proportion has climbed from 17 per cent before the conflict to 49 per cent today .
It has the highest relative score of any country .
Burundi surged from 9 percent to 30 per cent today and went on to elect a woman as Speaker of Parliament .
Mozambique more than doubled , from 16 per cent to 35 per cent .
Sierra Leone was at 1 per cent before the conflict started ; today , 14 per cent of parliamentarians are women .
What sets these countries apart ? We believe it is the fact that they have approached the peace process as an opportunity to instigate real change .
Countries like Rwanda and Burundi have given gender equality issues special attention and consideration from the very beginning of the peace process . They have actually written these issues into their constitutions .
They have established transitional national assemblies with greater participation by women and have introduced quotas at the institutional level .
They have made sure that women receive leadership training to run for election . The results speak volumes as to what countries should do when experiencing similar situations .
The IPU is present in many post-conflict countries .
Our efforts include working with women , helping them to develop their leadership skills and facilitating their work , both as candidates and subsequently as members of parliament .
We also seek to ensure that the institution of parliament is able to address gender issues , and we do so by raising awareness of these issues among women and men both .
Ensuring effective oversight is one key function of parliament , and it includes oversight of the security forces .
There are many ways in which parliament can and should exercise its oversight function in the field of security , and we are now working with many parliaments to assist them in introducing a gender perspective on security policy .
We are also assisting parliaments in analysing the national budget from a gender perspective .
This is particularly valuable when consolidating peace and making sure that the national budget is allocated in a manner that allows for the implementation of peace agreements , including those components that may be of particular importance to women .
The lessons we have learned from our fieldwork , from parliamentary diplomacy and from our political debates is that we must treat these peace processes as a continuum extending far beyond the final conclusion of an agreement .
We must take a long - term approach to ensure that peace is consolidated and not subjected to renewed threats .
We must also ensure that gender issues are addressed from the very beginning of the peace process and that women are included among those who negotiate peace agreements .
We have seen the value of transitional assemblies as a vehicle for improvement and , of course , an elected parliament is essential .
It is important that the gender composition of such assemblies be discussed early on as well .
There is a need to focus on these institutions , to give them the means they require to become effective , to sensitize men to gender issues , and to sustain this effort over a long period of time .
Let me conclude these remarks by reminding members of the Security Council of the declaration that 150 speakers of parliament adopted here at the United Nations last month . In that declaration , they pledge their support to the United Nations and United Nations reform .
They called for a strategic partnership between the organization that I represent here today , the IPU , and the United Nations , with more substantive interaction and coordination between the two organizations .
Specifically , they encourage the United Nations to avail itself more frequently of the political and technical expertise that the IPU , together with its member parliaments , can provide , particularly in areas relating to post-conflict institution - building .
The creation of a new Peacebuilding Commission at the United Nations offers an important opportunity to do so .
We look forward to working closely with the United Nations in turning this vision into reality .
The President : The next speaker is the representative of Namibia , to whom I give the floor .
Mr. Andjaba ( Namibia ) : I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) member States Angola , Botswana , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Lesotho , Malawi , Mauritius , Madagascar , Mozambique , South Africa , Swaziland , United Republic of Tanzania , Zambia , Zimbabwe and my own country , Namibia .
Let me thank the panellists for their informative and illuminating introductory presentations this morning .
We welcome the report of the Secretary - General ( S /2005/636 ) on women and peace and security .
I am delighted that it was during Namibia 's presidency of the Security Council in October 2000 that an open debate and discussions were initiated which culminated in the adoption of this landmark resolution — resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) — which we have the honour of reviewing today .
This five - year review presents us with an opportunity to pause and evaluate the progress we have made thus far in the implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
It is our fervent belief that this event will add the desired impetus to our commitment to fully realize all the goals and objectives of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
We are thus gratified by the efforts undertaken within the United Nations to develop a system - wide action plan to implement this resolution .
The action plan has provided us with a framework within which progress on the implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) can be coordinated , monitored and evaluated .
It is important that the action plan not reinvent the wheel but rather build on the achievements already made .
In that regard , we welcome the recommendation to review the adequacy of existing operational tools , guidelines and manuals for gender mainstreaming .
We further note with appreciation the fact that the action plan has taken into account the capacity of women in the areas of peacemaking and peacebuilding .
Women 's groups , especially those in the vicinity of conflict areas , have an important role to play , especially during the reconciliation , disarmament , demobilization and reintegration processes .
Local expertise needs to be fully utilized in all phases of conflict resolution and peacebuilding .
However , we note with concern that , although there has been some progress in the reporting of gender issues in the Secretary - General 's reports as well as in the work of the Security Council , gaps in reporting on gender and women 's issues continues to exist .
Thus , there is a need to critically examine the reasons behind the underreporting of gender and women 's issues and to take the necessary steps to remedy the situation .
We know that in many cases the non-inclusion of gender aspects is a result of inadequate capacity rather than reluctance .
We would therefore like to stress that continuous capacity - building on gender analysis skills both for staff and for stakeholders is crucial for successful implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
We call for closer collaboration between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations such as the African Union , the Southern African Development Community and the Economic Community of West African States , to mention but a few .
However , that will require capacity - building in terms of technical , human and financial resources .
We therefore call upon the United Nations system to assist in building the capacities of those organizations .
The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome document of the twenty - third special session of the General Assembly called for women 's participation to be equal to that of men and for their full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security .
An area of concern to us is the continued low representation of women in all phases of the peacebuilding process .
Despite the disproportionate impact of conflict on women , they continue to hold their families and communities together and often undertake initiatives across warring factions under extremely difficult conditions .
When involved , they bring their experiences into formal peace processes .
Thus , it is imperative that they be included in peacebuilding processes at all levels .
It is unfortunate that , more often than not , the efforts of women are insufficiently recognized and supported , both politically and financially .
As a result , women 's rights are rarely integrated into peace agreements or in the structures supporting post-conflict reconstruction .
We therefore urge that the role of women in those processes be built into the peace agreements from the very beginning .
The challenge before us is how to increase the number of women in all phases and at all levels of peace processes .
Men need to be sensitized on the positive contributions that women can bring to the negotiating table .
Both the United Nations system and Member States must make deliberate efforts to identify and support women 's participation in peace processes .
The inadequate representation of women in decision - making is not a phenomenon unique to peacebuilding processes .
Rather , it extends to all other areas .
In that regard , we urge Member States and the organizations of the United Nations system , within their respective mandates , to address the barriers women face in moving into decision - making positions .
The establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission has presented us with an opportunity to ensure that gender is integrated into the design and work of the Commission .
We must formulate concrete strategies , actions and programmes in a consistent and effective manner to advance the role of women in the area of peace and security .
We should ensure the effective participation of women in the Commission .
SADC condemns the use of sexual and gender - based violence against women and children as a weapon of war and also condemns widespread violations of their human rights .
We call upon all parties involved in conflicts to respect international humanitarian law and to ensure the protection of women and children .
Furthermore , the continuing sexual exploitation and abuse perpetrated against women and girls by some United Nations peacekeepers and other personnel is of great concern to us .
We urge the accelerated implementation of the Secretary - General 's recommendations on sexual exploitation and abuse .
Further , we urge troop - and police - contributing countries to take punitive actions against those involved in acts of sexual exploitation and abuse .
Finally , let me reaffirm SADC 's commitment to the full implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
The President : I now give the floor to the representative of Iceland .
Mr. Hannesson ( Iceland ) : Allow me , first , to express the satisfaction of my delegation , as a non - member of the Council , at being able to discuss the issue of women and peace and security in an open meeting on the fifth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
We thank you , Mr. President , for convening this meeting .
We wish , in particular , to thank the special panellists who spoke to the Council earlier and added valuable points of view to our deliberations .
At the outset , my Government would like to express its gratitude to the Secretary - General for his report on women and peace and security , contained in document S / 2005 /636 .
Resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) was a groundbreaking step forward in reaffirming the importance of the equal participation and the direct involvement of women in conflict prevention , peacekeeping and peacebuilding , as many have said before me .
By its adoption , it was finally recognized that women have an important role to play in peace processes and in achieving sustainable peace in conflict regions .
That landmark resolution is a challenge to us all , for it requires a fundamental change in procedure , delivery , attitudes and habits .
Since the adoption of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , considerable attention has been paid to its implementation within the United Nations .
That has been appropriate as we focus on ensuring the mainstreaming of a gender perspective throughout the work of the Organization .
We believe that in order to reach the Millennium Development Goals , it is important that a gender perspective be integrated into all strategies and programmes .
In that context , Iceland warmly welcomes the United Nations action plan for implementing resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) across the United Nations system , which has been presented to the Security Council in the report of the Secretary - General .
The system - wide action plan is an important tool for better coordination and for building on the synergies of the United Nations system .
With the adoption of the action plan , the United Nations is creating a good precedent which should encourage Member States to mainstream the gender perspective in their own policies .
We also hope that the Peacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding Support Office which our leaders decided to establish will demonstrate a strong commitment to the full implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
Women in war and women who have survived war must enjoy protection and justice , and women must be full agents in the shaping and rebuilding of their communities in the aftermath of war .
Therefore , we must ensure that the provisions of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) are realized and that women can fully and equally participate at all levels of decision - making with regard to conflict prevention and peacebuilding .
It is our duty to continue our work towards the full implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) at the national , regional and international levels .
The Icelandic authorities have put emphasis on supporting the implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
Indeed , an important part of Iceland 's development cooperation is directed towards facilitating a smooth transition from conflict situations , with special emphasis on women and their role in peacebuilding .
Here , Iceland 's support to the United Nations Development Fund for Women ( UNIFEM ) is especially worth highlighting .
Iceland 's contribution to UNIFEM has more than doubled this year .
And for the past few years , the Icelandic Crisis Response Unit has seconded a gender expert to UNIFEM in Kosovo .
Finally , I would like to underline that Iceland strongly condemns the sexual exploitation and sexual abuse committed by United Nations peacekeeping personnel , and we fully support the Secretary - General in his determination to uproot such behaviour .
Such abuse undermines our peace efforts and the credibility of the United Nations .
Efforts must be redoubled , and preventive education in this field must be a continuous feature of the training of the United Nations peacekeepers .
The President : I call next on the representative of Egypt .
Mr. Abdelaziz ( Egypt ) ( spoke in Arabic ) : It is my pleasure to address you today on behalf of the Arab Group and to express the Group 's appreciation for the comprehensive report of the Secretary - General on the fifth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) on women and peace and security .
I thank those who preceded me for reflecting on the United Nations system - wide efforts to strengthen commitment , accountability and transparency and to evaluate , monitor and report the progress realized .
The Arab countries work in close cooperation with the United Nations system to strengthen the means of protecting women during times of conflict , and to consolidate the role of women and their participation in post-conflict stages .
That is in concert with our belief in the major role that women play , especially under the exceptional circumstances represented by foreign occupation with the ensuing deterioration of the humanitarian and economic situation and negative effects on economic and social development .
However , an evaluation of the international situation , five years after resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) shows that we have not realized many of the objectives we had hoped for . Palestinian women are still suffering under the pressures of occupation , aggravated by the construction of settlements and the separation wall .
Consequently , the Arab Group calls upon the Security Council to take into consideration the situation of Palestinian women under foreign occupation , in addition to that of Syrian and Lebanese women in other occupied Arab territories .
The Council must work towards the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Arab territories occupied since 1967 , within the context of a comprehensive and just peace agreement , based on the implementation of United Nations resolutions , international legitimacy and the principle of land for peace .
It is difficult to speak of women without referring to a number of the initiatives taken by the Arab countries to enhance the status of women , not only in times of conflict but also in peacebuilding . The first is the establishment of the Arab Women 's Organization , which has become an effective Arab institution to safeguard and defend the rights of Arab women , leading towards the realization of the objectives of broader freedom and participation and overall advancement .
The organization also seeks coordination and cooperation among Arab countries in enhancing the position of Arab women , as they are the cornerstone for the solidarity of Arab societies . The organization seeks to coordinate the Arab positions in international forums that deal with women 's issues , regionally and internationally .
The second initiative is the first international movement for women , security and peace , which began in Egypt at a conference hosted in 2002 at Sharm el - Sheikh , a conference attended by governmental and non-governmental representatives and regional and international organizations and civil society and the United Nations .
The movement was registered as a non-profit organization in Geneva in 2003 and has acquired legitimacy as the first international movement that seeks to coordinate responses to calls for putting an end to violence against women in times of conflict and other times , and to enhance the role of women in peacemaking .
In conclusion , I would like to emphasize that we should make the best possible use of all the main organs of the United Nations , each with its original mandate , and without prejudice to the role of the General Assembly regarding humanitarian , economic , social and human rights conditions , including issues relating to women .
The Arab Group would like to state that international humanitarian activities should be carried out in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and international humanitarian law , especially with regard to the agreements relative to women — notably the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , and its two additional protocols , and the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women ( CEDAW ) , the Beijing Conference and its Plan of Action and the twenty - third special session of the United Nations General Assembly , entitled “ Women 2000 : gender equality , development and peace for the twenty - first century ” .
The President : I give the floor to the representative of Norway .
Mr. Løvald ( Norway ) : Norway welcomes the Secretary - General 's report including the system - wide action plan .
The document serves as a welcome follow - up of the outcome of the 2005 world summit .
With the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , the Council affirmed its commitment to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action .
Much has been achieved with regard to gender mainstreaming . However , when it comes to peacekeeping and post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation , much remains to be done to honour the commitments made .
There has not been a great increase in women 's participation in conflict resolution , and the protection of women living in situations of armed conflict is still a great challenge .
Despite the substantial efforts made by the United Nations following the reports of sexual abuse and exploitation by personnel in the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( MONUC ) last year , that continues to be a problem .
Sexual abuse and exploitation of civilians by peacekeepers is unacceptable .
It undermines the credibility of the United Nations and erodes the moral stature of the Organization .
The troop - contributing countries have a clear responsibility for the behaviour of their troops and must ensure that codes of conduct are enforced .
Impunity for serious acts of violence must end .
Member States should make every effort to contribute to systematic pre-deployment gender training for military and police .
We must help to empower local women and assist women 's networks and organizations to conduct public information campaigns to combat the culture of abuse and silence .
We can not put the entire responsibility on the troop - contributing countries .
The full backing of the United Nations Organization , including the Department of Peacekeeping Operations ( DPKO ) , is needed to reverse the negative trend .
Norway has offered to finance a study for the DPKO on lessons learned and best practices regarding how effective implementation of a gender perspective can contribute to the success of a peace mission .
Gender awareness must be recognised as the basis for the successful design and implementation of all post -conflict work .
Only ten missions have a full - time gender advisory position , while what is needed are teams of gender specialists to support the gender advisers in dealing with the huge requirements and the scope of programmes undertaken as part of the mission .
Gender awareness must be recognized as the basis for the successful design and implementation of all post -conflict work .
To ensure that a gender perspective is systematically integrated in policies and recommendations to the Peacebuilding Commission , Norway would support the inclusion of a senior gender adviser in the proposed Peacebuilding Support Office .
It is particularly important to improve the gender balance in peace missions .
Norway supports the Swedish proposal that the observer categories participating in United Nations peace missions should be expanded to include civilian observers .
This would broaden the recruitment base and make a better gender balance in United Nations peace missions more achievable .
The experience from mixed military and civilian Provincial Reconstruction Teams in the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) can provide valuable input to the discussion on the inclusion of civilian observers in United Nations peace missions .
Norway welcomes the action plans on gender mainstreaming and the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) from each of the peacekeeping missions .
It is crucial that the United Nations itself be a model for securing fair and balanced representation between the sexes at all levels .
The under-representation of women in the United Nations Secretariat , in particular at the senior level , is , therefore , a serious cause for concern .
Also important is the notion that incorporating a gender perspective into peacekeeping operations means ensuring that sex - disaggregated data are included in the Secretary - General 's reports to the Security Council .
This is necessary in order to understand the reality experienced in the field by women , men , girls and boys .
Empowering women locally is an important part of building lasting peace and laying the foundations for development .
Women are seriously under-represented in negotiations , in constitutional commissions and in political forums .
Obviously , this is an important challenge for the Peacebuilding Commission .
Enhancing political participation should be of highest priority .
The United Nations must be at the forefront in promoting women 's participation in electoral processes .
While there are no international standards on quotas or targets for gender representation , there is clear evidence that where quotas are applied , either voluntarily or by law , they are an effective way of securing women 's representation .
The trend seems to be that many countries receiving electoral assistance decide on their own to apply quotas for the representation of women .
Norway is confident that the United Nations has the necessary competence to assist countries in this respect .
The President : I now give the floor to the representative of Samoa .
Mr. Elisaia ( Samoa ) : I am honoured to address the Security Council on the question of women , peace and security .
In doing so , I speak on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum member States with Permanent Missions in New York - namely , Australia , Federated States of Micronesia , Fiji , Nauru , New Zealand , Palau , Papua New Guinea , Republic of the Marshall Islands , Solomon Islands , Tonga , Tuvalu , Vanuatu , and my own country , Samoa .
This year marks the fifth anniversary of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) on women and peace and security .
It is now a matter of international consensus that the role of women is fundamental to the maintenance of international peace and security .
At the 2005 world summit , our leaders reaffirmed this understanding .
Today , we would like to express our full and continuing support for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , which remains the most important and comprehensive framework for action at the international level .
We welcome the report of the Secretary - General on women and peace and security .
We urge the Security Council to continue to intensify its efforts to mainstream issues on women , peace and security into its work .
We wish briefly to highlight the most important steps that now need to be taken on the basis of the Secretary - General 's report .
First , there is a clear need for increased representation of women at all levels of decision - making in conflict prevention , management and resolution .
We hope to see more women appointed to senior positions in peace operations in the future , and to see Security Council support for such progress .
Secondly , the Security Council must act to protect the most vulnerable .
Special attention must be paid to the specific protection needs of women and girls to prevent gender - based violence , particularly rape and other forms of sexual abuse , in situations of armed conflict .
Thirdly , the Security Council must call for the prosecution of those who commit crimes against humanity , genocide and war crimes , including crimes involving sexual and other violence against women and girls .
There can be no impunity for such crimes .
Lastly , United Nations peace operations must lead by example .
We wish to see greater participation by women in peacekeeping missions and increased accountability for the implementation of gender mainstreaming in the United Nations as a whole .
The Pacific Islands Forum leaders welcomed the agreement reached at the world summit to establish a Peacebuilding Commission .
It is a matter of highest priority to us that this new body should support and promote the protection and promotion of the rights of women and build on international work relating to women , peace and security .
We urge Security Council members to ensure that a gender perspective is mainstreamed throughout the operations of the Commission .
The experience of Pacific Islands Forum countries in peacebuilding efforts in our own region makes this an issue of particular resonance for us .
The return of peace , following recent conflicts in Bougainville and the Solomon Islands , owes much to the role of women in the affected areas .
We acknowledge the efforts of those incredible women today , and we urge the Security Council to respect them by taking further action on this issue in the United Nations .
The President : I now give the floor to the representative of Australia .
Mr. Dauth ( Australia ) : Mr. President , let me begin by associating myself fully with the statement just delivered on behalf of the Pacific Island Forum .
At this stage of the day , I understand , of course , that just about everything has already been said , and Permanent Representatives — not including yourself , Sir — have fled the Chamber and , if they are lucky , they are pouring their first drink of the day .
So , I am sorry to add to the endless flow of statements , but it really is , of course , a very important issue .
If I may , let me associate myself with the remarks I just heard made by my Norwegian colleague about the need to accelerate our focus on the disgraceful record of sexual exploitation in too many United Nations missions .
This is a tangential issue in some ways today , but I do think it is very important indeed , and I am glad that it has been aired by our colleague , and I want to associate Australia with it .
We warmly welcome the reaffirmation by leaders at the summit of their commitment to the full and effective implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
Their reaffirmation of the landmark resolution adopted , as you know , five years ago demonstrates an increased international awareness of the gender dimensions of armed conflict and a recognition of the importance of women 's full involvement — full involvement — in all efforts to promote peace and security .
Women are often at the forefront of community - led conflict resolution and peacebuilding but are all too often excluded from higher - level peace processes .
We have recently seen the significant contribution that women can make to effective peacebuilding — as Ambassador Feturi Elisaia of Samoa just pointed out — in both Bougainville and the Solomon Islands .
We strongly encourage the participation of women in efforts at all levels to bring about and maintain peace and security .
Australia strongly supports continued efforts to implement the resolution , and we are pleased to have contributed financially to the Secretary - General 's study on this issue .
We attach importance to providing continued training on resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) to Australian Defence Forces personnel .
In that regard , we welcome the Secretary - General 's new , comprehensive plan for reinforcing and integrating women 's issues into the world body 's peacekeeping and post-conflict operations .
Greater sensitivity to the interests of women will also make a vital contribution to the challenge we face in addressing sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers — which is not being done urgently enough .
That is an appalling situation and a blight on a key area of United Nations activity .
Through our aid programme we are continuing to focus attention on implementing resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
We have developed a training module on conflict analysis and peace , as well as on conflict impact assessments , which include gender components for use in our development assistance programmes , and we are continuing to incorporate the concepts of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) into those programmes .
Following the violence in the Solomon Islands in 2000 , for example , the Community Peace and Restoration Fund , whose goal was to contribute to the overall process of the restoration of peace and development , provided a critical peace dividend for the entire population .
It enabled the delivery of immediate , direct and practical assistance to communities throughout the country and included 95 projects specifically for women .
Under our Solomon Islands programme , we are also supporting a range of non-governmental organization activities to support community resilience and promote inter-community peace .
We have also supported a peacebuilding and women 's empowerment programme , which seeks to promote community - based trauma counselling initiatives , peacebuilding and reconciliation between communities .
In Sri Lanka we are funding a number of activities specifically designed to reduce the scope of conflicts among communities .
Those include a programme to address the impact of armed conflicts on women .
The programme works with women affected by conflicts in the northern and eastern districts , as well as displaced Muslims and women in central Sri Lanka .
We recognize that progress has been made on the implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) and certainly we welcome the work done to date in that regard .
However , we must continue to ensure the increased participation of women at all levels and all stages of peace operations and to work towards the greater involvement of women in peacebuilding efforts .
Australia reaffirms its commitment to playing its role in achieving those objectives .
The President : I now give the floor to the representative of El Salvador .
Mr. Martínez Flores ( El Salvador ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : El Salvador welcomes the convening of this open debate by the Security Council in observance of the fifth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) on women , peace and security .
That is an innovative mechanism , in which efforts to advance and promote women cut across every area of conflict prevention — from the peace negotiation process to post-conflict reconstruction .
In that regard , my country is grateful to the Secretary - General for his report on peace , women and security ( S/2005/636 ) , which outlines a United Nations system plan of action to implement resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
Five years have elapsed since the adoption of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , and we would point out that positive and concrete results have been made through incorporating a gender perspective in this area — both in terms of measuring the impact of armed conflict on women and girls , as well as in the role of women in peacebuilding .
Our heads of State and Government lent their political support to the world summit outcome document ( General Assembly resolution 60/ 1 ) , which undertakes to transform the commitments made in resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) into concrete action .
The threats faced by civilians during armed conflicts , in particular women and children , underscore the importance of mainstreaming a gender perspective as a fundamental part of early warning activities as well as conflict prevention measures .
Therefore , we welcome the initiatives designed to establish early warning indicators with a gender perspective .
That would contribute substantially to a better understanding of the ties that exist between gender and security .
We are convinced that that linkage should be examined more thoroughly , both within the framework of the Security Council , as well as within the Commission on the Status of Women .
We support the decision of the Security Council to include gender issues targeted by resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) in the mandates of the various peace assessment and peacekeeping missions .
Thus far , we have seen that that policy has been welcomed in the field and that it has helped improve the image of members of United Nations peacekeeping missions .
In that context , we should point out that the Government of El Salvador has made a similar commitment along those lines , and we are pleased to recall that , at the request of the United Nations a few months ago , we have been participating with women police officers in the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara .
This is a recognition of the successful establishment of the civilian national police of El Salvador as an institution — established after the peace agreements .
It is also a pleasure to be able to return to the international community today the assistance that was given to us under the auspices of the United Nations during our own peace process .
In that regard , we hope that countries such as ours , which have made the transition from violent conflict to peace , will obtain the opportunity we deserve to share our experiences with other countries in the future Peacebuilding Commission .
In resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) the Security Council recommends that Member States and all the parties to a conflict should include women in the decision - making processes of peace negotiations , as well as in the implementation of political peace agreements .
El Salvador shares that point of view .
Given our own experience , we suggest that we should also consider the active participation of women in initiatives to educate for peace through the transmission of values that foster reconciliation and coexistence based on a culture of peace .
The United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization has made a fundamental contribution to El Salvador by promoting a series of initiatives , including , in particular , for the training of women to instil dialogue , tolerance and respect for difference in the rest of society .
Restoring public confidence after an internal conflict involves civic participation , where the role of women is essential .
We know that women contribute , through their complementary vision of reality , to identifying both short - and long - term priorities .
That is why their presence is necessary in consolidating democratic institutions , in strengthening gender justice and in legislative debate .
All of those reasons indicate that a gender balance should be maintained in decisions that affect public life .
When possibilities are open to them , women assume responsibility in the transition process , becoming the backbone of the fight against poverty .
In El Salvador we have learned that the transformation of society requires structures that foster equal participation in the new national project .
However , it is important to train a society so that it can enter the transition process , where a new coexistence based on peace , development and respect for human rights can be realized .
In that vein , it is up to the political parties to stimulate an extensive debate on equal participation and also to bring national policy decisions in line with the spirit of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
In conclusion , I would like to stress the Government of El Salvador 's desire to always include the participation of women and the defence of their rights in our ongoing effort to preserve a lasting peace .
The spirit of the resolution will show us the way .
We have confidence in the coordinated work of the organs of the United Nations system .
The President : I now call on the representative of Fiji .
Mr. Savua ( Fiji ) : We align ourselves with the statement made by the Permanent Representative of Samoa on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum .
We thank the Secretary - General for the action plan on the implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) on women and peace and security across the United Nations system , contained in document S / 2005/636 of 10 October 2005 .
The report is very comprehensive and written with a view to strengthening commitment and accountability at the highest levels and to allowing for improved accountability , monitoring and reporting on progress of implementation of the United Nations system .
Over the years , we in Fiji have always been mindful of the role of women in our society .
We do not question their importance or the critical role they play in the development of our nation .
The Secretary - General 's action plan is most welcome , as it has opened new avenues for the consideration of issues that may have been bypassed or regarded as too difficult .
Women in Fiji have served alongside their men in peacekeeping operations .
They have moved away from their traditional roles of working only in the logistics supporting areas to front - line operations .
These women are volunteers and like to serve in the promotion of international peace and security .
Most senior posts in United Nations peacekeeping operations are occupied by men .
We would like to see some women become the holders of senior posts that would reflect their contributions .
It is high time that we extend our gratitude for their contributions to peacekeeping and other areas .
One such area should be a commitment to develop a national action plan for the coordinated implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
Such an action plan should be public and be drawn up in consultation with civil society .
It should also contain specific and time - bound activities , targets and monitoring and reporting mechanisms .
Fiji and some of its neighbours will implement the action plan with the assistance of the United Nations Development Fund for Women ( UNIFEM ) , which over the years has been supportive of the launching of national policies and strategies to promote implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
We expect little change as a result of the efforts of UNIFEM and civil society this time around .
However , as has been stated , there must be some form of monitoring mechanism to ensure that national action plans are updated and that a review of the implementation of the action plan is conducted annually , starting in October 2006 .
For five years , the Security Council has been seized of the issue of women and peace and security .
Now that we have an action plan , we ought to move forward and establish a focal point and an expert - level working group to ensure the integration of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) into the Council 's work .
The plan is another milestone with regard to the issue of women and peace and security , and the journey continues .
There will be other milestones .
For example , we would support a request that the Secretary - General make recommendations to the Security Council by October 2006 on various means by which the Council could be more systematically informed of the use of gender - based violence by parties to armed conflict , paying special attention to the machinery already developed to monitor and report to the Council on violations against children in armed conflict .
We would also wish to hear about various means by which the Council could do more to hold parties to armed conflict accountable for those violations by considering , for example , the imposition of targeted sanctions against such parties .
Women and peace and security is an issue that should be of interest to all of us , regardless of where we come from .
Indeed , all issues concerning women should receive appropriate and equitable responses .
The action plan is , in our view , appropriate to the issue in question .
It is now incumbent upon all of us to ensure that it is implemented fully in all its aspects .
The President : I now call on the representative of Myanmar .
Mr. Swe ( Myanmar ) : First of all , I wish to thank you , Mr. President , for the initiative you have taken in convening today 's open debate on women and peace and security .
It has now been five years since the Security Council adopted the landmark resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
By means of that resolution the international community chose to see women not merely as victims in conflict situations , but as active participants in conflict resolution and peacebuilding .
The 2005 World Summit Outcome ( General Assembly resolution 60/1 ) gives an added impetus to that notion by recognizing the importance of providing women with the opportunity for equal participation and full involvement in efforts to maintain and promote peace and security .
Women and girls are among those who suffer most in armed conflicts .
Therefore , they have a strong desire for peace and security and yearn to take an active part in the peace process .
The underlying causes of conflicts are many and varied .
In most cases , poverty , socio-economic and gender inequalities and underdevelopment are its root causes .
In the case of my country , a union made up of more than 100 national races , the weakness of the constitution that was imposed upon us at the time of independence was the main cause of conflict .
Because of that weakness , Myanmar had to face armed insurgencies barely a few months after we had regained our sovereignty in 1948 .
It was only recently that we were able to achieve national reconciliation , and 17 insurgent groups came back to the legal fold .
Their representatives have now joined other delegates in the national convention that is laying down the principles of our new constitution — a constitution that will be acceptable to all nationalities of the Union .
I am happy to say that the women of Myanmar are taking active part in the national convention .
Resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) also contains the important component of ensuring the protection of and respect for the human rights of women and girls .
In Myanmar , the Government was instrumental in establishing the Myanmar Women 's Affairs Federation and has been actively implementing policies to promote and protect the rights of women and girls .
I wish to commend the Secretary - General for submitting an action plan for the implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) on women and peace and security throughout the United Nation system .
I have noted that the action plan contains strategic programmes as well as quick - impact strategies .
We are happy to see that the plan is structured around 12 important areas of action .
We are particularly pleased that preventing and responding to sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations staff , related personnel and United Nations partners is included as one of those action areas .
Myanmar 's values , tradition and culture abhor the sexual exploitation of women .
We therefore strongly support the implementation of a zero - tolerance policy .
We are also happy to see that the action plan includes accountability machinery .
I am confident that the action plan and the recommendations contained in the report , as well as the Peacebuilding Commission established by the 2005 world summit , will contribute meaningfully to the promotion of the role of women as envisioned in resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
The President : I now give the floor to the representative of Bangladesh .
Mr. Chowdhury ( Bangladesh ) : It has been five years since the adoption of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , a resolution with which Bangladesh , then sitting in the Council , was very closely associated .
I wish to begin by thanking you , Mr. President , for giving us the opportunity to take stock of the progress made in implementing the resolution since then .
I also wish to praise Romania for the excellent conduct of the Council 's presidency during the current month .
In the past , conflicts were largely inter- State or inter-empire .
More recently , they have been intra-State , with subregional and regional ramifications .
In many ways — more than in the past — civilians form the bulk of the victims .
Two millennia ago , the Greek sage Aristotle wisely observed that all wars were waged for the sake of getting money .
Not much has changed since then .
But our power of analysis has grown over time , and we now observe — perhaps more keenly — that poverty , the struggle for scarce resources and socio-economic injustices lie at the heart of conflicts .
And all of them , sadly , entail grave violations of human rights .
It does not take much scrutiny to come to the conclusion that the most vulnerable segment of the civilian population comprises women and children .
That is evident everywhere .
Women and girls are often viewed as bearers of cultural identities .
Thus , they become prime targets .
When women suffer , so do children .
In addition , children are used as instruments for the perpetration of violence , as that can be done easily and cheaply .
The current hotspots of the world are replete with such examples .
Women know the price that they and their children have to pay in conflict situations .
It is natural , therefore , that they are keen and often better equipped to prevent and resolve such situations .
They have sought to do so over generations as peace educators , both in their families and in their wider societies , fostering a culture of peace within and across communities .
They often , therefore , aptly serve as bridge - builders of understanding across rivers of strife .
It is in that perspective that Bangladesh , as a member of the Security Council , worked closely in the adoption of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
The resolution was primarily based on a simple thesis .
It was that women 's equal access to and full participation in all layers of the power structure , as well as their full participation in the prevention and resolution of conflicts , are essential elements for making and sustaining peace .
The Bangladesh presidency issued a statement to that effect on International Women 's Day in March 2000 .
Eventually , the process culminated in the resolution .
Needless to say , Bangladesh remains committed to its full implementation .
Drawing from our domestic experience , we believe that gender mainstreaming and empowerment are critical factors for development .
Access to education and health care , coupled with the provision of microcredit facilities , can unleash the entrepreneurial skills of individuals .
We know that such empowerment of women helps stave off extremist thought and action .
That includes the scourge of terrorism .
Today , by adhering to those very values , Bangladesh itself is undergoing a quiet but significant societal transformation .
Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia and her Government have an unflinching commitment to those goals .
The United Nations should work as a conduit for disseminating homegrown ideas and best practices , such as microcredit and non-formal education , that have proven to work in my country and many others societies of comparable milieu .
Those ideas can be applied in post-conflict societies with the major involvement of women .
They will form the bulwark of peacebuilding .
Success in implementing the resolution , in our view , has been mixed .
While we have integrated gender perspectives in some aspects of United Nations peacekeeping operations and also in some post-conflict peacebuilding efforts , much work remains to be done .
We encourage the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to continue its efforts in that direction .
The excellent presentation this morning by Under - Secretary - General Jean - Marie Guéhenno , as well as his leadership qualities , give us the confidence that the desired results will come to fruition .
Bangladesh , as one of the consistently top contributors of troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations , remains conscious of its responsibilities to incorporate essential elements of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) into the pre-deployment training of its peacekeepers .
The non-participation or insignificant participation of women in peace agreement negotiations is still a problem .
Those peace agreements inevitably fail to address the special needs of women .
Although women suffer most as victims of conflict , they are excluded from peace dividends .
Our endeavours to resolve those conflicts and address their root causes will fail if we do not empower women .
The formal participation of women in peace negotiations and decision - making processes is key to the effectiveness of conflict prevention .
The 2005 world summit outlined several policy frameworks important to millions of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict situations .
The operationalization of the peacebuilding commission by the year 's end would be a giant step in that direction .
Increased focus on conflict prevention ; responsibility to protect populations from genocide , war crimes , ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity ; the effective promotion and protection of human rights ; and enhanced rule of law are some of the achievements of the summit that would go a long way towards empowering women in the longer term and towards enhancing their role in conflict prevention and resolution .
We welcome the proposed system - wide action plan on the implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
It is our hope that it will be instrumental in integrating gender perspectives across the entire United Nations system .
Such gender mainstreaming , of course , must take into account geographical , ethnic and cultural factors .
To be successful , the action plan will require the necessary resources — financial , material and human .
That would have to be at all levels .
The active participation of civil society is a sine qua non .
Every generation must seek to bequeath to the next a better world .
Ours must do the same .
For that purpose , we must identify some ideals and seek to achieve them .
It is such pursuits that lend vigour to our societies and create the positive ferment that is the primum movens of civilizations .
Also , they help us to achieve greater heights across a broader spectrum of human endeavour .
The President : I now call on the representative of Peru.
Ms. Tincopa ( Peru ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : My delegation congratulates you , Sir , on convening this open debate on resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) on women , peace and security , five years after its adoption .
We believe that it will highlight the need to continue deepening the debate on a document that reflects a change in our way of thinking about the impact of armed conflict on women and girls and about women 's participation in preventing conflicts , promoting peace and assistance to post-conflict reconstruction .
The world is acquiring a paradoxical reality in the twenty - first century .
It is globally integrated in the productive processes , trade , financial flows and the communications revolution , yet it is fragmented by the proliferation of conflicts , internal wars , transnational terrorism and ethnic and cultural violence .
Since the cold war , more than 33 civil conflicts have erupted or been revived in the developing world , causing more than 5 million deaths and creating almost 17 million refugees and displaced persons , among whom women and girls have been particularly affected because of their status in society and their gender .
Five years after the adoption of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , and despite the efforts made to implement it , we are far from achieving the goals that we committed ourselves to therein .
In that regard , we feel that the international community must continue using all available international instruments to end human rights violations against women and girls , as well as the impunity of those responsible for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , including acts of violence against women .
We are aware that the international courts have an important role to play in that regard , but we believe that it is equally important that States first assume their responsibility for enacting justice and punishing the perpetrators .
As to my country , the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established in June 2002 to determine accountability for the violence and terrorism that occurred in Peru between 1980 and 2000 , including gross violations of human rights .
In August 2003 , after two years of investigation , the Commission presented its final report , containing a comprehensive reparations plan that the Peruvian Government has begun to carry out through a collective peace and development programme .
I cite that example in order to acknowledge the work and leadership of the women 's organizations that , with the support of the United Nations Development Fund for Women , participated in the post-conflict process and contributed to the recognition that persons who were sexually violated during the conflict and the children born as a result of such violations are entitled to compensation .
With that recognition of their suffering and material support , women are now better placed to resume their role in society .
We believe that the time has come to close the gap between words and reality .
In that regard , we welcome the system - wide action plan that the Secretary - General has annexed to his report , focusing on strategies and activities that seek to improve the contribution of the United Nations system to the empowerment of women in conflict areas , and highlighting as a main goal the urgent need to strengthen coordination and accountability .
We believe that the action plan must be updated as necessary and that we must continue to seek and develop effective monitoring mechanisms that will ensure its ongoing implementation .
We also feel it important that the first review of the plan take place in October 2006 .
I wish to reiterate that States must take the requisite firm steps to remove the obstacles that prevent women from being effectively involved in decision - making processes and from having access to the highest levels of the hierarchies of power .
In that regard , we reaffirm the commitments we entered into in the outcome document of the 2005 world summit ( General Assembly resolution 60/ 1 ) , in which we reaffirmed our responsibility to fully and effectively implement resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
The inclusion of a gender perspective in developing and carrying out the work of the Peacebuilding Commission is of crucial importance , given that the Commission 's main goal will be to bring together all relevant actors to marshal resources and promote comprehensive peacebuilding and post-conflict recovery strategies .
The future Human Rights Council too will be of relevance to promoting and protecting the rights of women .
In conclusion , I would like to thank Mr. Guéhenno , Ms. Mayanja , Ms. Heyzer and the other participants for their work on behalf of women .
The task is still to be completed .
It should be carried out jointly by States , the United Nations system and civil society , especially women 's organizations and groups .
The President : I now give the floor to the representative of Liechtenstein .
Mr. Wenaweser ( Liechtenstein ) : Six weeks ago , the world 's leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the full and effective implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
The fact that this resolution is one of only two Security Council resolutions that found explicit reference in the summit 's outcome document ( General Assembly resolution 60 / 1 ) is a clear sign that its adoption five years ago was a landmark decision .
The resolution has the potential to profoundly change the way the Organization deals with conflict prevention , conflict resolution and peacebuilding .
However , that potential has yet to be fully used .
The fifth anniversary of the resolution 's adoption provides a welcome opportunity to assess the impact the resolution has had on the ground and to identify ways and means to accelerate its implementation at the local , national and international levels .
We commend the remarkable work undertaken by the 37 United Nations entities that have contributed to the elaboration of the system - wide action plan .
That plan provides a wealth of information on activities being carried out for women in conflict and post-conflict situations .
It should facilitate the review of the impact of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
In order to make that possible , it will be necessary to provide for interaction and consultations with civil society , in particular women 's non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) .
At the national level , such interaction could form the basis for the establishment of action plans for the implementation of the resolution .
That would help to raise awareness of the need to promote the active participation of women in decision - making regarding all aspects of conflict prevention and peacebuilding .
Without such active involvement , decision - making will continue to be ineffective .
For that reason , we are also of the view that the mandate of the Peacebuilding Commission should include an explicit commitment to partnering with civil society , including women 's organizations , through formal mechanisms at Headquarters as well as at the country level .
That would go a long way towards ensuring that women 's needs , priorities and roles in peace processes are duly taken into account in the work of the Peacebuilding Commission .
To that end , 14 women Foreign Ministers , including the Foreign Minister of Liechtenstein , have signed a letter on the issue of the Peacebuilding Commission .
In order for women to be heard and for their concerns to be taken into account , they must be involved in peace negotiations .
There is ample evidence that women are very active in informal peace processes .
However , that is not the case in formal processes .
All too often that is due to the fact that women are hardly represented in the official groups that are common players in conflicts and their settlement , such as Governments , political parties , armed groups and militias .
In addition , a lack of knowledge of the manner in which formal processes are conducted or of international legal and other standards is often presented as an excuse for not including women in such formal processes .
Strengthening women 's capacity as peacemakers must be pursued in parallel with increasing women 's participation .
At the same time , women need to be encouraged and empowered to hold decision - making positions .
Creating awareness of peace negotiations as a tool for achieving gender equality is essential .
Against that background , we have constantly advocated the appointment of women as special representatives and envoys of the Secretary - General .
Such appointments could play a major catalytic role in more strongly involving women in peace processes , especially when they reach more formal stages .
They would also strengthen the awareness of the need to mainstream gender issues not only into peace processes but also into other political processes .
We are of the view that the number and consistency of such appointments should become an essential element for the review of the implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) and part of an overall assessment with regard to the nomination of women at the higher levels of peacemaking , peacekeeping and peacebuilding .
At the same time , we are aware of the need to provide the Secretary - General with names of well - qualified potential candidates for such posts .
We therefore invite all interested States and NGOs to join forces in gathering the necessary information to make the appointment of women to such posts not only a priority but a reality .
The President : I now give the floor to the representative of Croatia .
Mrs. Mladineo ( Croatia ) : Croatia has aligned itself with the statement made by the representative of the United Kingdom on behalf of the European Union , but I would like to add a few points based on Croatia 's specific experience and achievements on the matter .
At the outset , allow me , on behalf of my delegation , to commend the Romanian presidency for organizing this open debate to mark the fifth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , on women and peace and security .
Since 2000 , the international community has increasingly come to recognize not only how much conflict particularly affects women and girls , but also how often women hold the key to its peaceful resolution .
It will be important to examine ways in which the provisions of this important cross-cutting resolution can be better implemented at the regional and national levels .
Croatia welcomes the United Nations system - wide action plan produced by the Secretary - General ( see S/2005 / 636 ) , which aims at highlighting the importance of gender perspectives in conflict prevention and peacekeeping activities .
In order to achieve success in the post-war confidence - building process it is essential to include women as active participants in post-conflict reintegration and reconstruction .
That has also been borne out by Croatia 's experience .
The protection of women in armed conflict and women 's fundamental role in conflict prevention and peacebuilding can not be evaluated without taking into account that women are among those most affected by violence and the economic instability resulting from armed conflict .
Yet , when it comes to negotiating peace , post - war reconstruction and reconciliation , women are grossly underrepresented .
We should continue to press the main bodies of the United Nations , particularly its funds and programmes , to strengthen the participation of women in their work and to streamline gender issues .
Post - conflict transition , recovery and reconstruction can not be achieved if gender equality and the promotion of women 's rights are absent .
Croatia welcomes the increased involvement of women in peacekeeping operations , especially among human rights and humanitarian personnel , military observers and civilian police .
In that connection , we strongly encourage the practice of mainstreaming the gender perspective into peacekeeping operations .
At the same time , we must increase our efforts to improve the protection of women in armed conflict , parallel to acknowledging and enhancing their contribution to peace processes and to rebuilding their communities .
The Commission for Gender Equality of the Republic of Croatia — an intergovernmental commission entrusted with creating policies and coordinating all activities for the promotion of gender equality — incorporated a chapter on women and armed conflict in the national policy for the promotion of gender equality for the period 2001 - 2005 and in its implementation programme .
Both documents were adopted by the Croatian parliament in December 2001 .
Some tangible results have already been achieved in pursuing the goals set out in the national policy .
One such result was the inclusion of the study of international humanitarian law and human rights in the curriculum of the Croatian military academy as an integral part of the military education of the armed forces .
Special emphasis is placed on the promotion and protection of women 's human rights and the introduction of measures aimed at combating violence against women in war , in armed conflict and during post-conflict transition .
We seek to apply a gender perspective in Croatia 's participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations .
During 2005 , two Croatian women officers have been serving in the peacekeeping missions in India and Pakistan and in Cyprus .
Currently , five women officers from the Croatian armed forces are serving within the German contingent of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan .
Preparations are taking place for a female officer to serve as a military psychologist in the peacekeeping mission in Haiti .
In addition , a captain of the Croatian armed forces was the first female officer to take part in the Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan .
Of course , the success of the application of the principles and underlying themes of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) rests with Member States .
In that regard , there is more that we all can do to ensure that women can fully and equally participate at all levels of decision - making with regard to conflict- prevention and peacebuilding .
The President : I now give the floor to the representative of Canada .
Mr. Laurin ( Canada ) ( spoke in French ) : I am pleased to take the floor today on behalf of the Human Security Network , a cross-regional group of 14 countries — Austria , Canada , Chile , Costa Rica , Greece , Ireland , Jordan , Mali , the Netherlands , Norway , Slovenia , Switzerland , Thailand and , as an observer , South Africa .
On behalf of those countries , I would like to express our appreciation to Romania for having convened this open debate on women , peace and security — a priority issue for the Network — and to thank the panellists today , who have spoken with such conviction .
At the 2005 world summit , the leaders reaffirmed their determination to fully and effectively implement resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
As we mark the fifth anniversary of that resolution and look to other important commitments , such as the protection of civilians and children in armed conflict , as well as to important milestones such as the 10 - year review of the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , it is clear that we have the necessary tools for strong and concerted action in all situations of conflict and post-conflict reconstruction .
The creation of the Peacebuilding Commission is essential if we are to preserve and build on international peace and security .
In this year 's report to the Security Council on women , peace and security , the Secretary - General urged Member States to take concerted action to integrate a gender perspective into the Commission 's mandate and work .
We have a golden opportunity to ensure that , from the outset , the Commission 's work incorporates the knowledge and the lessons learned from the implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
Effective and sustainable peace , justice and security will remain a distant goals if we do not view them from a gender perspective .
The Human Security Network welcomes the letter sent to the Secretary - General and the President of the General Assembly by the women foreign ministers on this issue .
The countries of the Human Security Network will work with other Member States to ensure that the Peacebuilding Commission fully integrates such an approach in its structure , mandate and practice .
In this spirit I thank the Secretary - General for his report , which outlines the United Nations system - wide action plan for the implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
The Network applauds the efforts of the Secretary - General and the United Nations system in this area and warmly welcomes the action plan , which it commits to supporting in full .
In this context , the Human Security Network strongly supports the Secretary - General 's recommendation to appoint a high - level focal point or focal points to monitor the progress of implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) within the United Nations system .
In addition , and as at last year 's open debate on women , peace and security , the members of the Network call on the Security Council to seriously consider establishing a mechanism to monitor its own actions to integrate resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) and other resolutions into its daily work , possibly through a focal point or expert - level working group .
Furthermore , as States Members of the United Nations , we should all consider developing action plans and coordinated strategies at the national level for the implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) — a process that Canada has already begun .
( spoke in English )
Among the gaps identified by the Secretary - General in his report are the lack of systematic incorporation of gender perspectives in peace agreements and the lack of enhanced women 's participation in formal peace processes .
Those elements were the focus of the expert group meeting hosted by Canada in preparation for last year 's session of the Commission on the Status of Women , which developed a framework for model provisions on peace agreements as a means of promoting gender equality and ensuring women 's participation in peace processes . The Network welcomes that outcome .
Women are highly active and effective in informal peace processes .
The challenge lies in their participation in formal processes where peace agreements are negotiated .
There , women have been frozen out of the peace process and given no room at the peace table .
In addition , a further challenge is that formal peace processes rarely take gender perspectives into account .
The Human Security Network is committed to taking concrete steps to enhance the role of women and to integrate gender equality in peace processes more effectively , thereby strengthening the legitimacy of decision - making processes and , by so doing , assisting in laying the groundwork for a meaningful and sustainable peace for all .
The Network maintains that the involvement of all of society at every step , including women and women 's groups , is crucial to the enduring success of the entire peace process , from negotiation to implementation of a peace agreement .
In order to achieve that , capacity - building in the area of gender equality , women 's rights and the gender - differentiated experiences of security is required for all actors , both men and women , as is an active search for women leaders .
Members of the Network urge the Security Council to systematically incorporate gender considerations in all aspects of mission planning and execution , particularly from the outset .
This would result in directing peace support action towards security that is as real for women as it is for men .
Concretely , that could mean , for example , that women 's enhanced role in transitional justice mechanisms would more likely bring to immediate attention impunity for acts of violence and seek robust measures to address it .
The Human Security Network would like to reiterate the importance of achieving gender justice and welcomes the conferences held recently on this issue in New York and in Stockholm .
As we noted last year during the open debate on this topic , sexual and gender - based violence remains alarmingly pervasive in conflict - affected areas .
The referral by the Security Council of the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court , and the Court 's investigation into the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Uganda , are very positive steps , yet they are testimony to the widespread allegations of horrific abuses against women and children in conflict situations .
In this year 's report , the Secretary - General highlights once again that further action is required to prevent , document and report on gender - based violence , as we have not yet done enough .
The Network reiterates that it is the role of the Security Council to work together with countries and Governments , as well as with the International Criminal Court , to prosecute such crimes and to eliminate the impunity with which they are perpetrated .
In that regard , the Network welcomes the recent adoption by world leaders at the world summit of the principle of the responsibility to protect .
We were particularly pleased that the threshold for action that was endorsed is an inclusive one , in that it holds not only genocide and war crimes but also crimes against humanity as a trigger for action .
The definition of crimes against humanity includes all of the most egregious examples of gender - based violence — the horrific results of which we have seen in too many conflict areas .
We must continue to work to ensure that the international community has both the capacity and the political will to operationalize the responsibility to protect .
In particular , a rigorous monitoring and reporting mechanism for gender - based violence will be essential to ensure that States shoulder their responsibility not only to prevent such violence but also to protect their own citizens from such crimes .
In conclusion , the Human Security Network believes that it is the role of the Security Council to ensure that planning and implementation of all multidimensional peace support operations fully integrate a gender analysis and aim to strengthen the many and varied roles of women in peace processes , whether of a political , humanitarian , development , policing or civilian nature .
Members of the Network thus strongly urge the Council to give full consideration to the report of the Secretary - General containing the United Nations system - wide action plan on the implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , and to implementing the recommendations therein .
We look forward to future discussions in this forum during which we can hear reports of how resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) has been implemented in specific conflict situations and how it has made a difference in the lives of women .
The President : The next speaker is the representative of South Africa , to whom I give the floor .
Mr. Mabhongo ( South Africa ) : We are honoured to participate in today 's open debate , especially given that this is the fifth anniversary of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) on women and peace and security .
My delegation associates itself with the statement made on behalf of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) by the delegation of Namibia as well as with the statement made by the delegation of Canada on behalf of the Human Security Network .
As we commemorate the fifth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , we are realizing now more than ever the important role of women in efforts to achieve peace and security .
Time and again , women have played a constructive and essential part in peace processes .
They are gradually finding a place at the negotiating table , in the implementation of peace agreements , and in post-conflict rehabilitation , reconstruction and disarmament .
It is high time for them to be included in those processes in a more formalized way , at all levels and at all stages .
The continued under-representation of women in formal peace processes and other persistent obstacles and challenges resulting from situations such as gender - based violence , poverty , lack of rule of law and various forms of discrimination prevent women 's full and effective participation in conflict resolution .
Conflict destroys infrastructure and disrupts essential services , which has a negative impact on the livelihoods of women .
We believe , therefore , that more must be done to achieve greater participation and effective contributions by women in developing and implementing post-conflict strategies and programmes .
In addition to resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , we already have other instruments at the regional and global levels which recognize and seek to enhance the role of women in peace processes .
We should use these instruments , and we believe that , with sufficient political will , we can meet the demand for greater inclusion of women in peace negotiations .
Resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) calls for the full inclusion of women in international peace and security processes and for action in four critical areas . We note that progress has been made in a number of those areas .
However , it is clear that there is still room for improvement , especially with regard to the mainstreaming of gender consciousness in United Nations reporting and implementation systems .
These goals , as set out in resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , can become a reality only if there are improvements in terms of information , coordination and cooperation , as well as strengthened commitment and accountability at all levels of the United Nations system .
Enhanced cooperation with regional organizations and Member States , as well as civil society and women 's national machineries , is also essential , we believe , to its successful implementation .
My delegation therefore notes with appreciation the United Nations system - wide action plan for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , as contained in the report of the Secretary - General .
This working document identifies numerous actions that different role - players within the United Nations system can take to further its implementation and which can be used to monitor progress .
We encourage immediate implementation of the Secretary - General 's proposals so as to put this action plan into practice .
Member States can also enhance the United Nations system - wide action plan by continuing to implement resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , including through the development of national action plans or other national - level strategies .
The decision by the 2005 world summit to establish the Peacebuilding Commission is , in our view , an important milestone and makes a further contribution to the full implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
It opens the door for women with a view to ensuring integration of the gender perspective in all phases of peacebuilding .
Our own experience in South Africa has taught us that , given a chance , women can bring an important and much needed perspective to peace processes .
Women are no longer simply the victims of wars and conflicts ; they are increasingly an important part of the solution .
We would urge the Peacebuilding Commission , once established , to pay particular attention to the knowledge and understanding women can bring to peace - building processes .
It is disheartening that sexual and gender - based violence , including trafficking in persons , continue to be used as weapons of war in conflicts .
In some parts of the world , gender - based violence has reached near - epidemic proportions .
Every effort must be made to halt this odious practice and to bring the perpetrators to justice .
My delegation also wishes to reiterate its condemnation , in the strongest terms , of all acts of sexual misconduct by all categories of personnel in United Nations peacekeeping missions .
In that regard , South Africa welcomes the comprehensive report on sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations peacekeeping personnel .
We express our support for the efforts of the United Nations to fully implement codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and to enhance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms .
We note with appreciation the strategies and actions included in the system - wide action plan aimed at fully implementing those codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures .
In conclusion , as we look back at the five years of the implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , we realize that peace starts with women and that for peace to be sustainable , we should ensure that women live more secure and productive lives and are able to fully enjoy their human rights and fundamental freedoms .
We should recognize their invaluable role and contribution as mediators , educators , peacemakers , peacebuilders and advocates for peace .
In our view peace attained through the participation of all means , not only the silencing of guns after war but a sustainable effort at ensuring lasting peace and prosperity .
My delegation therefore supports the Secretary - General 's report before the Security Council as well as all of the initiatives undertaken by the United Nations in implementing resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
The President : The next speaker on my list is the representative of Malaysia , to whom I give the floor .
Mr. Mohd . Radzi ( Malaysia ) : Let me join others in expressing our appreciation to you , Mr. President , and your delegation for convening this open debate of the Council on the important question of women and peace and security , especially in the context of the fifth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) concerning the participation of women in peace processes .
We would also like to thank Under - Secretary - General Jean - Marie Guéhenno for his remarks and the other invited speakers for their important contributions .
Resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) and the three subsequent presidential statements on women and peace and security ( S / PRST / 2001/31 , S / PRST / 2002/32 and S / PRST / 2004/40 ) constitute an important landmark and provide a practical framework for our action .
The Council has clearly acknowledged the importance of bringing gender perspectives to the centre of all United Nations efforts related to peace and security and has called for appropriate action under a number of thematic and cross-cutting areas .
My delegation commends the efforts of the Inter - Agency Task Force on Women and Peace and Security , in partnership with Member States and non-governmental organizations , in the preparation of the system - wide action plan , which will put greater focus on enhanced collaboration for the full implementation of the resolution .
In that regard , my delegation noted with interest the action plan contained in the annex to the report of the Secretary - General on women and peace and security ( S /2005/636 ) .
At the recent 2005 world summit , our leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the full and effective implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
They underlined the importance of integrating a gender perspective and of women having the opportunity for equal participation and full involvement in all efforts to maintain and promote peace and security , as well as the need to increase the role of women in decision - making at all levels .
We are disappointed that , despite the adoption of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , there seems to have been a merely nominal increase , if any at all , in the number of women participating in formal peace processes .
Women 's needs and concerns continued to be ignored in peace agreements , and women 's organizations are often not given the necessary support to enable them to participate , especially in protracted peace negotiations .
It is our hope that the adoption of the 2005 World Summit Outcome ( General Assembly resolution 60/ 1 ) will provide new impetus leading to the actual realization of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
We call on all Member States , regional and subregional organizations and the United Nations system to enhance the role of women in decision - making with regard to all peace processes and to post-conflict reconstruction and rebuilding of societies .
In that regard , my delegation welcomes the various initiatives and actions undertaken by Member States , United Nations entities , civil society organizations and other relevant actors focused on supporting and increasing the representation of women in peace negotiations and mainstreaming gender perspectives into peace agreements .
While we share the concern at the underrepresentation of women in formal peace processes , we are equally alarmed at the persistent obstacles and impediments women face as a result of situations such as violence against women , shattered economies and social structures , lawlessness , poverty and limited access to education and resources .
Action must be taken to remove those obstacles and impediments .
Malaysia believes that more needs to be done to achieve the greater participation and the effective contribution of women at the negotiating table and the involvement of women in developing and implementing post-conflict strategies and programmes .
In that regard , my delegation encourages the Secretary - General to maintain regular contacts with women 's organizations and networks , make use of their knowledge , expertise and resources and ensure their system - wide involvement in reconstruction processes , particularly at the decision - making level .
We wish to express our abhorrence at the continuing victimization of and violence against women and girls , especially in situations of armed conflict , and the systemic use of abduction and rape by parties to a conflict as an instrument of war .
We would like States to take the necessary measures against all perpetrators of such acts , in accordance with the principles of international law and domestic legislation , and to make provisions for the protection of women and girls in armed conflict .
We wish to reaffirm the relevance of section E , on women and armed conflict , of Chapter IV of the Beijing Platform for Action .
My delegation condemns in the strongest terms all acts of sexual misconduct by all categories of personnel in United Nations peacekeeping missions .
We welcome the comprehensive report on sexual exploitation and abuse by the United Nations peacekeeping personnel contained in document A /59/710 , and the report of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations on its resumed session ( A/59/19 /Add.1 ) .
In that connection , we join the Council in supporting the efforts of the United Nations to fully implement codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and to enhance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms .
We are convinced that the strategies and actions included in the system - wide action plan to fully implement the codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures may contribute to the reduction and , hopefully , the elimination of sexual exploitation and abuse .
Malaysia believes that the issue of women in relation to peace and security deserves the Security Council 's sustained attention .
It is our hope that the Council 's deliberations on this issue will contribute to the enhancement of the role of women in peace and security and ensure the protection of women in situations of armed conflict .
Other interlocutors within and outside the United Nations system could also be major and vital players in that endeavour and should be continuously engaged .
Malaysia is committed to working with others that share a similar interest in advancing that agenda and ensuring the full mainstreaming of women in activities in the pursuit of securing peace and security .
The President : I now give the floor to the representative of Germany .
Mr. Trautwein ( Germany ) : At the outset , let me express our gratitude to the Romanian presidency for putting this important item on the Council 's agenda .
Today , the thoughts of my delegation and of other delegations are with Aung San Suu Kyi , who still can not play her important and necessary role in her country 's endeavours for peace and security , reconciliation and democratization .
Germany associates itself with the statement of the presidency of the European Union delivered this morning by the representative of the United Kingdom and would like to add the following remarks .
Justice is classically represented as a female goddess : Justitia . In armed conflicts , however , crimes committed against women are the ones most likely to go unpunished .
That is why we can not overestimate the historic significance of the explicit inclusion of gender - related crimes and crimes of sexual violence in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court , for which 100 States will soon have deposited their instruments of ratification .
Germany , as a member of the group of friends of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , welcomes the fact that the mandates of United Nations missions now regularly make reference to that important Security Council resolution .
Increasingly , questions related to resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) are discussed in both open and closed meetings of the Security Council .
During our term on the Security Council , we actively worked towards that goal .
Whether in the context of approving peacekeeping mandates or of reviewing the impact of sanctions , gender implications must continue to be an integral part of the analysis and the decisions of the Council .
In that context , we encourage the Security Council to include a stronger gender perspective in the upcoming mandate for the United Nations mission to the Great Lakes region .
Five years after the adoption of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , we are still struggling with the problem of sexual exploitation , abuse and the solicitation of prostitutes in peacekeeping operations .
We strongly welcome the zero - tolerance policy of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations ( DPKO ) to fight those shameful acts .
Germany actively supports the work of the Ambassador of Jordan and fully shares his concern that the issue of sexual exploitation must not disappear from our agenda and must be vigorously persecuted .
Germany , among like - minded countries , is actively contributing to the steering committee for the DPKO workshop on policy dialogue to review best practices for enhancing gender balance among military personnel in United Nations peacekeeping operations , which is planned for early 2006 .
Germany itself began to integrate women into the armed forces in 2001 and is strongly committed to maximizing the number of female soldiers in the field .
Germany welcomes the outcome document of the recent world summit ( General Assembly resolution 60 / 1 ) and the strong commitment expressed in that important document to the full and effective implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) and to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action .
It underlines the vital link that exists between gender equality and peace and security in the world .
We consider the decision to establish a Peacebuilding Commission as one of the greatest achievements of the summit .
It is of vital importance that a gender perspective be integrated in the Peacebuilding Commission and that such perspective be reflected in the mandate of the Commission as well as in its structure .
The outcome document stresses the importance of the inclusion of civil society in country - specific meetings .
Germany believes that the inclusion of women 's organizations will be of particular importance .
Women are too often seen only as victims of armed conflicts .
They are indeed key to ending conflicts and to stabilizing war - torn countries .
Effective implementation of gender equality and increased involvement of women in all aspects of society can contribute significantly to reducing violence and preventing conflict .
The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women , the Beijing Declaration , the Beijing Platform for Action and Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) are clearly complementary and are human rights instruments of the utmost importance .
Women are indispensable agents in the process of building democratic structures and strengthening civil society .
Five years after the adoption of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , women remain a largely untapped human resource in peacebuilding .
Let us all work together to complete the important task .
The President : I now give the floor to the representative of Austria .
Mr. Pfanzelter ( Austria ) : Austria fully endorses the statements of the European Union and the Human Security Network .
Allow me to elaborate a few points .
In 2000 , Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) called for women 's equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security .
Little progress has been made since then .
Women remain marginalized in the process of peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction .
At the 2005 world summit a few weeks ago , our heads of States and Governments reaffirmed their commitment to the full and effective implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) and to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action .
Austria firmly believes that women must be able to participate fully in peace negotiations , peace agreements and the development of a stable society .
Now , the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission provides us with a unique opportunity to ensure the involvement of women in United Nations - led peacebuilding processes .
Let us use this opportunity by integrating a gender perspective in both the mandate and the structure of that new United Nations body .
That concept is contained in the letter addressed by women foreign ministers — including Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik — to the Secretary - General and the President of the General Assembly .
The Peacebuilding Commission should ensure , as part of its mandate , that women and women 's groups are represented in peace processes , thus enabling them to play a meaningful role .
Concerning the structure of the Peacebuilding Commission , Member States and organizations involved in its work should bear in mind the desirability of gender balance in all meetings of the Peacebuilding Commission .
Austria believes that a gender advisor should participate in all meetings of the Peacebuilding Commission in its country - specific configurations in accordance with paragraph 100 of the summit outcome document .
Moreover , special representatives , special envoys and other emissaries involved in peace negotiations should have firm guidelines to enhance women 's participation in peace processes and transitional structures .
Experience shows that a determined policy on the part of the international community in the immediate post-conflict phase in favour of women 's participation , inter alia by ensuring that post-conflict legislation gives them a right to participate , can increase the long - term participation of women in political processes in their countries .
As an example , the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which is currently taking action to enhance implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , has , with its handbook on monitoring women 's participation , already achieved important results regarding the role of women in elections as voters , candidates and officials .
Austria welcomes the United Nations system - wide action plan for the implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2005 ) proposed by the Secretary - General in his report .
We now have a window of opportunity , with the United Nations reform process .
It is up to each of us — Member States and the United Nations — to seize this opportunity and enhance women 's participation in conflict prevention , peacemaking , peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction .
The President : I call next on the representative of Sri Lanka .
Mr. Kariyawasam ( Sri Lanka ) : Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) on women and peace and security , adopted five years ago , is a landmark achievement .
The review of its implementation is of immense importance to the international community because while we deliberate on this important subject , millions of women and children in all parts of the world still remain mired in disease , poverty and the adverse effects of terrorism .
Resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) was a result of the increasing realization of the need to address grave and systematic violations of the human rights of women and children in situations of armed conflict , as well as the recognition of the capacity of women and the contribution that they can make in peacebuilding .
While the General Assembly , the Commission on Human Rights and the Commission on the Status of Women have addressed these issues from time to time , the Security Council — the United Nations apex body mandated to ensure international peace and security — by this resolution provided an impetus to mainstream gender perspective in promoting peace and security .
Today , women and children account for the majority of civilians adversely affected by armed conflict .
They are subjected to grave violations of human rights and to violence at the hands of repressive elements .
In situations of armed conflict as well as during war - to - peace transitions and peacebuilding phases , women 's needs are rarely addressed with the seriousness that they deserve .
In all such situations , it has been observed that women are more vulnerable and invariably suffer most .
That is partly a direct result of violence targeted against them .
It is often due to an uneven share of responsibility that women have in running the household , caring for children and even earning a living for the family as war widows .
In many situations , a level playing field in terms of gender parity still remains beyond the reach of women .
The effect of armed conflict on the girl - child has been a grave concern in Sri Lanka for some time .
Recruitment of children , including girls , to the ranks of an armed group in the conflict in Sri Lanka is a continuing worry for our people .
The armed group LTTE , in gross violation of its commitments , continues such recruitment .
This affects women in general , who are the primary care givers in most families .
This situation where children , in particular girls , are being affected by armed conflict can not and should not be allowed to continue by the civilized world , and the imposition of targeted actions against the perpetrators of such crimes is a paramount necessity .
In our view , for any national or international action plan to be more effective and result - oriented , it should evolve through a process of consultation with civil society and other relevant actors , and it should contain a time - bound set of targets with monitoring and reporting mechanisms .
The Government of Sri Lanka supports such processes worldwide and also as part of its national approach to peace and reconciliation .
In this context , we view Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) as a groundbreaking initiative .
The resolution sets forth responsibilities that should be borne by the international community and Member States of the United Nations to ensure a gender perspective and security for women in its multidimensional aspects related to peace , security and peacebuilding .
Against this backdrop , it has now become incumbent upon the Security Council to review the progress made in the implementation of its resolution , as well as to consider further practical measures to strengthen the safety net and security for women in situations of armed conflict and to promote their role in peacebuilding .
In doing so , it is essential that the Security Council consider the following important measures .
First , the Council should establish a focal point to ensure the integration of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) in the Council 's work programme , as well as in mandates , processes and mechanisms of all relevant United Nations agencies .
Secondly , it should request the Secretary - General to update , monitor and review the United Nations system - wide action plan on an annual basis .
Thirdly , it should determine means by which the Council could be systematically informed of the use of gender - biased violence by parties to armed conflict .
It is time that the United Nations redoubled its efforts in taking immediate , coherent and coordinated actions to translate the commitments undertaken in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , as well as in Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
My delegation fully supports all such efforts in the manifestation of Sri Lanka 's commitment towards the protection of women and children in armed conflict and , more importantly , to further our belief in the value of the participation of women in peacemaking and peacebuilding processes .
May I conclude by recalling the words of Eleanor Roosevelt :
“ For it is not enough to talk about peace . One must believe in it .
And it is n't enough to believe in it . One must work at it . ”
The President : I now give the floor to the representative of Guinea .
Mr. Sow ( Guinea ) ( spoke in French ) : Mr. President , first of all , I would like to tell you how much my delegation appreciates your organizing this meeting and the competent manner in which you have been leading the work of the Council this month .
I would also like to thank Mr. Jean - Marie Guéhenno and Mesdames Rachel Mayanja and Noeleen Heyzer for their dedication to the cause of women and peace and security , as well as for the useful information and relevant analyses they have given us .
My delegation viewed with keen interest this morning the UNIFEM documentary , which underlines the relevance of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
We would like to express our gratitude to Mesdames Sweeta Nori , Hélène Dandi , Elsie - Bernadette Onubogu and Mr. Anders Johnsson for the wealth of experience they have been so kind as to bring to our attention .
Resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) raises not only the problem of armed conflict 's impact on women and girls and the role of women and girls in conflict prevention and resolution , but also their contribution to peacebuilding , as well as the commitment of various actors in the international community to shoulder their respective responsibilities in the implementation of the resolution .
My country greatly appreciates the attention given to the resolution and the efforts under way by various actors in the international community for its effective implementation .
We believe that the organization of today 's meeting proceeds from the determination and willingness of the Security Council to continue to shoulder its responsibilities in this regard .
During the consideration of this item on 25 July 2002 , my delegation pointed out , inter alia , that as part of the responsibility incumbent on the various actors in the implementation of the resolution , each body of the United Nations system should clearly identify the areas in which it could make its contribution and subsequently find areas of complementarity with the other bodies .
Today , as we thank the Secretary - General for his report ( S/2005/636 ) , we note with interest the development of a system - wide plan of action for the United Nations to implement resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , thanks to the work of the Inter - Agency Task Force on Women , Peace and Security , in partnership with other actors .
We welcome the identification of the 12 areas of action and the suggested approaches in the individual and collective responsibility of various bodies of the United Nations system .
We feel that the action plan requires a more in - depth consideration in order to allow for a better understanding of the various responsibilities mentioned therein .
Until we reach that point , my delegation supports the objectives and the timetables set out in the report , especially the periodic evaluation by intergovernmental bodies and inter-agency organs of the efforts of the United Nations system regarding the action plan .
We emphasize the importance of the United Nations Chief Executives Board for Coordination , the Executive Committee on Peace and Security , the Executive Committee on Humanitarian Affairs and the United Nations Development Group in strengthening their collaboration so as to allow the inter-institutional organ to carry out its work successfully .
We are of the view that intergovernmental bodies — among others , the Security Council , the General Assembly , the Economic and Social Council and the Commission on the Status of Women — and the competent expert bodies should continue to play a crucial role in monitoring and following up the responsibilities of United Nations bodies .
When the Peacebuilding Commission enters into force , it should also be involved in this exercise .
Furthermore , my delegation emphasizes the importance of sending to the Security Council useful information on the implementation of the resolution , so as to correct the gaps noted in the report .
In adopting the outcome document at the world summit , held in New York from 14 to 16 September , world leaders at the highest level recognized gender equality and the promotion of women , emphasizing the importance of women 's role in conflict prevention and settlement , as well as in peacebuilding , and reaffirmed their commitment to the effective and full implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
To this end , my delegation appreciates the interest that the various actors in the international community continue to give to the resolution , especially on this fifth anniversary of its adoption .
We welcome the fact that the United Nations system has undertaken a planning effort that is as broad as it is complex , encompassing all the areas of activity covered in the resolution .
We hope that , as already mentioned in the document , the strategies and activities included in the action plan might allow for an improvement in the contributions that the United Nations system will make to enhancing the activity of women in areas of conflict .
Furthermore , while the implementation of the action plan is incumbent first and foremost upon the United Nations bodies , it goes without saying that cooperation with the other actors , especially the Member States , non-governmental organizations and civil society , is absolutely necessary for the effective implementation of the resolution .
While appreciating the methodological approach and accountability of the United Nations bodies , my delegation hopes that the periods for review of the action plan will enable us to consider a global strategy for the implementation of the resolution , taking into account the comparative advantages of all the actors involved .
In that connection , my country , the Republic of Guinea — with its experience in crisis management in the West African subregion , with its desire to involve Guinean women and with the support of the network of women in the Mano River Union in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peacebuilding — will continue to give its support to collective efforts .
In conclusion , I would like to indicate that we subscribe to the Secretary - General 's conclusions and recommendations ( S /2005 /636 ) and we encourage the Security Council and the international community to work tirelessly for the effective implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
The President : I now give the floor to the representative of Kenya .
Ms. Bahemuka ( Kenya ) : I would like to thank the Romanian presidency for organizing this meeting on an issue that we hold very dear to our hearts .
In his statement to the General Assembly on 17 September 2005 , His Excellency President Mwai Kibaki of Kenya placed women strategically at the centre of all development activities .
Today , with the steady and sure progress towards the establishment of a Peacebuilding Commission , the role of women in initiating , nurturing and consolidating post -conflict peacebuilding is a given .
In our remarks during recent informal consultations , my delegation stressed the need to incorporate this important element early on in building the formal architecture of the Peacebuilding Commission , as well as the need to deepen the role of women in the implementation of programmes to empower them in post-conflict areas .
My delegation thanks the Secretary - General and his staff for the very useful report on women , peace and security contained in document S / 2005 /636 dated 10 October 2005 .
The guidelines in that document covers areas dear to my delegation .
Those include , inter alia , mainstreaming gender in peacekeeping and political affairs ; monitoring compliance with international law ; expanding gender - sensitive programming in disarmament , demobilization , reintegration , mine - clearance , reconstruction and HIV / AIDS prevention ; institutionalizing women 's participation in decision - making ; and preventing and fighting against gender - based violence , including sexual exploitation and abuse .
Regarding the enhancement of local women 's capacities for peacemaking and peacebuilding , I would only urge greater synergy and energetic interface with local women 's groups .
That coordination will build on local best practices and obviate the need to reinvent the wheel .
At the intergovernmental level , I would appeal for closer coordination .
The idea of working through the High Level Committee on Programmes , with the participation of all concerned organizations and components of the United Nations Secretariat , is a very good one .
Our experience in using a system of lead agencies to ensure dialogue , as proposed in the report , suggests that such a plan has to be very carefully implemented .
Institutional conflicts and jealousies may arise that can hamper any long - term gain for women .
The same can be said for coordination within the United Nations itself .
Appointing a group of focal points instead of one focal point may diminish the institutional rivalry that so frequently manifests itself in our work .
Kenya also supports the Secretariat 's recommendations to biennialize reporting on implementation of the action plan .
That can be supplemented by interspersed thematic reports , which , we agree , will balance the implementation and policymaking cycles and make for more rigorous implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
In conclusion , let me highly commend the many women who toil daily in the fields of the United Nations system in the area of peace and security .
I thank them for their dedication , hard work and commitment to the cause of the Organization .
I encourage them to continue their work fearlessly and tirelessly , for the final objective is beneficial for all mankind .
The President : I now give the floor to the representative of Israel .
Ms. Eilon Shahar ( Israel ) : At the outset , Israel would like to thank you , Mr. President , for convening this open debate on women , peace and security as we mark the fifth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
On issues having to do with economy , politics , diplomacy , security and all other aspects of our society , Israel firmly believes that women must play an equal role .
We have no doubt that the progress and advancement of women will translate into nothing less than progress and advancement for all .
To that end , Israel remains committed to the goals and objectives of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , as well as to the principles outlined in the outcome document recently adopted by our leaders at the world summit .
The outcome document appropriately reaffirms the commitment of all Member States to the full and effective implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) .
As in all other areas , Israel is convinced that women must play a key role in questions of peace and security .
We believe that an increased role for women on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides of the negotiating table will positively reshape the outcome of peace negotiations .
The Israeli parliament continues to devote considerable attention to bolstering the role that women play in this area .
For example , the Israeli women 's equal rights law was recently amended — in the spirit of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) — and now mandates that the Israeli Government must include women in any group appointed to peacebuilding negotiations and conflict resolution .
That legislation deals specifically with the adequate representation of women in shaping national policy and with the explicit goal of integrating women in all governmental boards and bodies established for the purpose of designing public national policy in foreign and interior affairs , including the resolution of international conflicts , inter alia , through peace treaty negotiations .
Because Israel believes so strongly in the contribution of women to peacebuilding , the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sponsored a series of seminars on the voice of women in conflict resolution and peacebuilding at the Golda Meir Mount Carmel International Training Center in Haifa .
The goal of the seminars is to open dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian women and further education towards peace .
Of the 300 participants thus far , 50 per cent have been Palestinian women .
Those efforts are augmented by the work of numerous Israeli — and specifically women 's — non-governmental organizations , which represent a wide spectrum of Israeli society and politics .
Their active contribution and involvement in influencing Israel 's agenda on peace issues , among others , have been widely felt .
For Israel , the topic of peace and security is fundamental .
Israel has endured more than 20,000 terror attacks in recent years .
Just yesterday , Israel sustained yet another suicide bombing , which like so many of its predecessors , claimed the lives of innocent civilians .
I would like to take a moment of the Council 's time to address the comments made previously by my colleague from Egypt .
In fact , he brings up a good point : Palestinian women are currently suffering .
But , since the topic has been raised , let us be very clear as to the exact nature of the suffering .
The seemingly endless barrage of Palestinian terror attacks against Israel has resulted in the murder of thousands of innocents .
Palestinian terrorist organizations have time and time again exploited Israeli goodwill gestures and manipulated social realities to perpetuate terror attacks against Israelis .
On numerous occasions women have abused their status to cross security checkpoints with explosives and other weapons .
In fact , several Palestinian women have succeeded in carrying out fatal suicide bombings .
Thanks to the security procedures that my colleague decries , Israeli forces have arrested Palestinian women intent on carrying out suicide bombings .
Just this past July , for example , Israeli security forces managed to apprehend a woman who had attempted to exploit a medical visa in order to carry out a suicide bombing in the very hospital in which she was receiving treatment .
So , without question Palestinian women are suffering , but they are suffering at the hands of terrorist organizations that take advantage of women 's status to carry out barbaric attacks .
At a time when the Middle East is enjoying a new momentum as a result of Israel 's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank , it is our hope that all parties in the region will capitalize on the new opportunities presented .
We firmly believe that women should play a unique role , helping the region to take advantage of this new era of hope .
Both the status of women and the prospects for the future of the region are severely jeopardized when terrorists and their supporters manipulate women for evil purposes .
Israel is committed to further advancing the role of women because it is right .
Israel is resolved in its determination that women will play an increasingly active role in peace negotiations , because we recognize the unparalleled value of their contribution .
And Israel stands here today , full of hope that an enhanced role for women in peace negotiations will build bridges of understanding in Israel and with our neighbours .
The President : There are no further speakers inscribed on my list .
I am sure we all agree that this was a rich and meaningful debate .

Progress report of the Secretary - General on the United Nations Office in Timor - Leste
( for the period 13 May to 15 August 2005 )
Introduction
By its resolution 1599 ( 2005 ) of 28 April 2005 , the Security Council decided to establish the United Nations Office in Timor - Leste ( UNOTIL ) and requested me to keep it closely and regularly informed of developments on the ground , the implementation of the mandate of UNOTIL , and the planning for a transition to a sustainable development assistance framework by 20 May 2006 .
The Council also requested me to submit a report by 28 August 2005 .
The present report covers major developments on the ground since my end of mandate report on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor ( UNMISET ) dated 12 May 2005 ( S /2005/310 ) and describes the activities undertaken by UNOTIL since its inception .
Recent political and security developments in Timor - Leste
During the reporting period , the overall situation in Timor - Leste remained calm and stable , except for a few isolated incidents involving mostly martial arts and political opposition groups .
In order to curb the violent activities of martial arts groups , a series of initiatives was undertaken , with the support of President Xanana Gusmão , which culminated in the signing of a joint declaration by 14 groups on 30 June .
The signatories to this declaration committed themselves to preventing , reducing and eradicating acts of violence between martial arts groups .
On 22 July , six members of a political opposition group were detained in Lautem district following violent clashes with the local community , which reportedly opposed the group 's opening of an office and the raising of its flag in the village of Pitilete .
Following the incident , from 22 to 29 July , the Timorese national police conducted coordinated search operations of that group 's premises across the eastern part of the country , reportedly seizing items including military uniforms , machetes , knives , flags , a firearm and ammunition .
Subsequently , the coordinator of the group submitted a complaint to the Provedor for Human Rights and Justice .
Local elections were held in two phases in the districts of Cova Lima , Ermera and Viqueque , on 12 and 18 May , and in those of Ainaro , Aileu and Manufahi , on 27 June and 2 July .
The elections were conducted in a peaceful and orderly manner , and the average voter turnout reached about 86 per cent .
While the ruling party won a relative majority , opposition and independent candidates fared well , especially in Cova Lima and Ermera , jointly securing about half of the contested seats .
Although some technical difficulties primarily involving voter verification continued to be encountered , improvements were noted in voter education and in the level of cooperation between the Secretariat for the Technical Administration of Elections ( STAE ) , the local authorities and the police .
Local elections have now been held in 11 of Timor - Leste 's 13 districts , and preparations have begun for the final round to be held in the districts of Dili and Liquica in late September 2005 .
Further advances were made towards strengthening the Timorese institutional and legal framework .
Two important organs provided for in the Constitution , namely the Superior Council for Defence and Security and the Council of State , were inaugurated on 12 and 17 May respectively , providing the President with the institutional support required for implementation of his mandate .
The Provedor for Human Rights and Justice and his two Deputies were sworn in by the National Parliament during the reporting period .
The office of the Provedor provides an important legal instrument to address , inter alia , the continued reports of human rights violations by the Timorese police , including excessive use of force , ill - treatment and arbitrary arrest and detention .
On 25 July , the National Parliament approved the statute of the Office of the Public Prosecutor , which establishes the procedure for appointment of the Prosecutor - General , sets out the organic structure of the Office of the Prosecutor - General and provides for the Superior Council of the Prosecution Service .
On 29 July , the Parliament gave its authorization for the adoption of the penal code and of the penal and civil procedure codes by government decree .
A decree law on restructuring of the Government was promulgated on 28 June , raising the total number of ministries from 10 to 15 and establishing , inter alia , five new Secretary of State posts for the coordination of regional development and investment programmes .
Pursuant to the law , on 27 July Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri officially announced the composition of the new Government , which has 41 members , of whom 7 are women and 2 have strong ties with an opposition party .
The new Government was sworn in by President Gusmão on 28 July .
Another major legislative development that occurred during the reporting period was the approval by the National Parliament of the draft law on freedom of assembly and demonstration on 18 July 2005 , following a positive decision of the Court of Appeal on its constitutionality .
The parliamentary resolutions to ratify the Conventions on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations and the Specialized Agencies were also approved by the National Parliament on 19 July .
Moreover , during the reporting period , the National Parliament approved the law on the Petroleum Fund , the law on petroleum taxation and the law on petroleum activities .
The laws on domestic and external investment , the parliamentary laws on the juridical regime of real estate ( part II ) and on licensing , oversight and regulation of insurance companies and insurance brokers , and Government decrees on the Institute of Health Sciences and on the statutes for hospitals were also promulgated during the period under review .
However , no progress was registered on the formulation of key legislation for the establishment of the High Administrative Tax and Audit Court , as mandated by the Constitution , or on the drafting of the electoral law for the parliamentary elections scheduled to be held in 2007 .
Following the signing of a joint declaration by Prime Minister Alkatiri and the bishops of Dili and Baucau on 7 May , acknowledging that religious teaching must be included as a regular discipline in the school curriculum , relations between the Government and the church have normalized .
On 9 June , the Council of Ministers approved a new curriculum that includes one hour of religious teaching per week during normal school hours , attendance being subject to parental consent .
The joint working group established pursuant to the 7 May declaration , comprising 40 representatives from the Government , the Catholic Church and other religious denominations , met twice during the reporting period to examine proposals to reform the state education curriculum and other issues of concern .
Relations between Timor - Leste and Indonesia continued to improve .
The foreign ministers of the two countries met in Bali on 18 and 19 June to address issues related to the bilateral Commission for Truth and Friendship and their common border .
Subsequently , a Timorese delegation travelled to Jakarta to attend the third meeting of the Joint Ministerial Commission on 7 and 8 July .
A number of outstanding issues were discussed , including border issues .
According to the joint statement issued at the end of the meeting , agreement was reached , inter alia , on completion of negotiations on unresolved segments of the common land boundary by the end of the year ; the establishment of a new border management mechanism between Timor - Leste and Indonesia 's border security agencies ; the opening of a bus line from the enclave of Oecussi to mainland Timor - Leste ; and the issuance of border passes to the residents of border areas .
On 1 August , the Governments of Timor - Leste and Indonesia officially announced the names of the 10 members — 5 from each country — of the bilateral Commission for Truth and Friendship .
The Commission met for the first time in Denpasar , Bali , on 4 and 5 August , to discuss matters related to its internal structures , working procedures and programme of work .
The 10 members of the Commission and five of their six alternates were sworn in by President Gusmão and his Indonesian counterpart , President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , at an official ceremony held on 11 August in Bali , where the Commission 's joint secretariat is located .
On that occasion , the two Presidents also signed a memorandum of understanding on the establishment of the Commission .
The Commission of Experts which I established to review the prosecution of serious human rights violations committed in Timor - Leste in 1999 ( see S/2005 / 310 , para . 8 ) visited Jakarta from 18 to 20 May .
During its visit , the Commission of Experts met with a number of relevant officials , including President Yudhoyono , the Minister for Foreign Affairs , the Commander - in - Chief of the Indonesian army , the Attorney General , the Chief Justice and public prosecutors .
The Commission of Experts submitted its final report to me on 27 May , and I subsequently shared it with the Governments of Indonesia and Timor - Leste , for their comments , and with members of the Security Council .
President Gusmão and Prime Minister Alkatiri conveyed their views on the report in separate letters addressed to me , dated 22 June .
The report of the Commission of Experts and the comments of President Gusmão and Prime Minister Alkatiri were issued as Security Council documents on 22 and 25 July , respectively ( S / 2005/458 and S/2005/459 ) .
Contribution of the United Nations
Role of the Mission
Pursuant to Security Council resolution 1599 ( 2005 ) , by which the Council called on relevant stakeholders “ to start immediate planning for a smooth and rapid transition from a special political mission to a sustainable development assistance framework ” , UNOTIL has placed special emphasis on the coordination of donor assistance and encouraged the implementation of measures towards sustainable long - term development in Timor - Leste .
To this end , UNOTIL organized a “ brainstorming ” retreat with officials of the Timor - Leste Government , representatives of the diplomatic community , United Nations agencies , multilateral financial institutions and non-governmental organizations in Dili on 9 June , to discuss strategies and assistance programmes for the implementation of the Mission 's mandate .
Subsequently , in accordance with paragraph 6 of resolution 1599 ( 2005 ) , my Special Representative , Sukehiro Hasegawa , established a consultative group to coordinate the assistance efforts of these stakeholders .
The first meeting of the consultative group , chaired jointly by my Special Representative and Prime Minister Alkatiri on 28 June , was opened by President Gusmão and discussed the transition from UNOTIL to a sustainable development assistance framework .
Specific consideration was given to the need to retain a number of key civilian adviser posts beyond the expiration of the UNOTIL mandate ( see para . 20 below ) .
The second meeting of the consultative group , held on 26 July , addressed the institutional capacity development of the Timorese national police ( see para . 26 below ) .
In accordance with paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 1599 ( 2005 ) , UNOTIL has also instituted an internal monitoring , review and coordination mechanism known as the policy review and coordination meeting .
Its primary purpose is to bring together a number of stakeholders , including civilian advisers , development partners , representatives of UNOTIL and other United Nations system actors , to monitor progress in the Mission 's programme areas , review policy measures taken by the Government and contribute to the work of the consultative group .
Pursuant to Security Council resolution 1543 ( 2004 ) , the Serious Crimes Unit , the Defence Lawyers Unit and the Special Panels for serious crimes concluded all activities on 20 May 2005 , as the UNMISET mandate came to an end .
However , in paragraph 9 of its resolution 1599 ( 2005 ) , the Security Council underlined the need for the Secretariat , in agreement with Timor - Leste authorities , to preserve a complete copy of all the records compiled by the Serious Crimes Unit.
As previously reported ( S/2005/310 , para. 19 ) , 10 staff members were retained until 30 June for this purpose .
During that period , they established copies of some 160,000 pages of the Unit 's records .
They also scanned about 10,000 photographs documenting forensic work and entered them into a database .
A handover ceremony was held in Dili on 3 June to mark the transfer of all court documents of the Special Panels for serious crimes to the Dili district court .
All court files are now closed except to legal parties and other members of the public requesting access approved by a judge , per order of the President of the Court of Appeal . All records compiled by the Serious Crimes Unit , including all the copies that have been made for preservation by the Secretariat ( see para .
14 below ) , are stored in the Office of the Prosecutor - General of Timor - Leste , which previously housed the UNMISET Serious Crimes Unit.
UNOTIL is helping to guard the premises of the Office of the Prosecutor - General , to ensure the security of the building and the records it contains .
Pursuant to paragraph 9 of Security Council resolution 1599 ( 2005 ) , UNOTIL is negotiating an agreement on the preservation and management of the serious crimes records with the Timorese authorities to regulate , inter alia , the conditions under which copies of the records would be held by the United Nations and the circumstances in which the Organization would grant access to them .
In this connection , an on - site evaluation was undertaken by the Archive and Records Management Section of the Secretariat to determine what arrangements needed to be made for the preservation of a full replica of these records by the Secretariat .
Meanwhile , all records of the Serious Crimes Unit are under the jurisdiction of the Prosecutor - General of Timor - Leste , and no copies may be transferred to UNOTIL until the agreement between the United Nations and the Government of Timor - Leste is finalized .
Once the agreement is concluded , the Secretariat will be required to undertake the preservation and management of the serious crimes records well beyond the expiration of the UNOTIL mandate , with considerable cost implications .
Programme I Support for the development of critical State institutions
By resolution 1599 ( 2005 ) , the Security Council authorized the continued deployment of up to 45 civilian advisers to further the development of critical State institutions .
Following a comprehensive review of the outstanding requirements of the Government and the public administration , 22 civilian advisers ' posts , which were already provided under UNMISET , were retained for another year , while 23 new posts were instituted .
In total , 2 advisers have been assigned to assist the Office of the President ; 3 have been assigned to provide support to the National Parliament ; 13 have been tasked to contribute to the functioning and further development of the Timorese judiciary ; while the remaining 27 advisers have been deployed across various Government offices , including the Office of the Prime Minister , the Office of the Inspector General and the ministries of justice , foreign affairs , planning and finance , interior , the State administration and transport , communications and public works .
During the reporting period , UNOTIL civilian advisers continued to focus on the transfer of skills and knowledge to their Timorese counterparts , particularly in the areas of democratic governance , rule of law , justice , human rights , transparency and accountability .
In this respect , seven legal advisers focused on strengthening democratic governance in the National Parliament and the Office of the President and contributed to the further development of the legislative framework of the public administration and the judiciary by helping with legal drafting .
The technical assistance provided by UNOTIL legal advisers , in particular , proved essential to the development of the recently enacted Petroleum Fund Act , which lays the legal foundation for an accountable and transparent management of hydrocarbons .
In a letter to the Electoral Assistance Division of the Secretariat dated 12 July 2005 , the Minister for Internal Administration , Anna Pessoa , requested continued assistance “ in drafting the whole scope of electoral laws and procedures needed for the national elections scheduled for 2007 ” .
By the same letter , Ms. Pessoa also requested support in negotiations with donors so as to obtain assistance in the areas of “ information technology , database management , capacity - building , electoral management , operations and logistics ” as required “ in order to hold the national elections in a satisfactory manner ” .
In consultation with the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) project manager for electoral assistance in Timor - Leste and the Electoral Assistance Division , UNOTIL is exploring ways in which its civilian advisers can help cover some of the needs for electoral assistance outlined in the Minister 's letter , as part of their efforts to assist the capacity - building of State institutions .
Despite significant progress towards the development of a viable justice sector , Timor - Leste continues to depend on the support of international advisers to ensure the proper functioning of the Courts , the development and enactment of relevant legislation and the training of national judicial actors .
Thus , 18 judicial advisers , including four groups of judges , prosecutors and public defenders in the four district courts , continued to perform line functions at both the Court of Appeal and district courts to help reduce the backlog of cases and to ensure access to justice services at the district level .
In this regard , although the serious crimes process terminated on 20 May 2005 in accordance with Security Council resolution 1543 ( 2004 ) , one international prosecutor and two international defence lawyers continued to assist the Timorese Court of Appeal so as to ensure the completion of pending trials .
During the reporting period , UNOTIL judicial advisers continued to provide training to 15 judges , 15 prosecutors and 10 public defenders , most of whom are expected to assume their duties in the national courts by May 2006 .
It is envisaged , however , that following completion of the training programme , the Timorese judges will continue to require on - the - job training , mentoring and supervision until the end of 2006 .
A coordinated strategy will need to be put in place to meet this requirement through assistance offered by bilateral and multilateral partners , and to ensure a smooth transition .
UNOTIL advisers in the areas of trade and investment continued to support the Government 's capacity - building efforts and to provide valuable technical assistance .
In the finance sector , eight UNOTIL advisers helped to enhance the transparency and accountability of the Office of the Treasury , the Office of the Inspector General and line authorities .
To this end , they focused , in particular , on the transfer of skills and knowledge and on the elimination of corruption through relevant public information , education and advocacy campaigns , as well as the implementation of corrective measures .
However , inadequate transparency and accountability in various sectors of public administration remains a matter of concern .
Instances of bribery , theft of public funds and corruption continue to be reported and appear to be on the increase , particularly in the areas of procurement and customs . At the first meeting of the consultative group ( see para .
10 above ) , the Minister of Planning and Finance stated that international support continued to be required to improve the public financial management system , as well as the management of oil resources .
As reported in paragraph 37 below , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) are expected to provide technical assistance in these areas .
Meanwhile , efforts are under way to phase out the assistance provided by UNOTIL civilian advisers before the expiration of the Mission 's mandate .
At its first meeting , the consultative group reviewed donors ' commitments to supporting a smooth transition from UNOTIL to a sustainable development assistance framework .
The pledges made by bilateral and multilateral donors included continued funding of key civilian adviser posts currently provided by UNOTIL .
Ultimately , while the World Bank is expected to secure funding for most civilian adviser posts in the finance sector , it is hoped that UNDP will be able to absorb key civilian adviser posts in the sectors of justice , rule of law and democratic governance .
As a result of these pledges , it may become possible to reduce the number of UNOTIL civilian advisers before May 2006 .
In the longer term , the requirements for advisory assistance are expected to decrease as additional progress is achieved in the development of State institutions .
The Capacity Development and Coordination Unit of the Office of the Prime Minister , for example , is expected to assume responsibility for coordinating the activities of UNOTIL and UNDP civilian advisers by the end of August 2005 , in an effort to entrust the Government of Timor - Leste with greater managerial authority and responsibility , as well as to enhance the coordination of institutional capacity development support programmes .
Programme II Support for further development of the Timorese police
By its resolution 1599 ( 2005 ) , the Security Council authorized the continued deployment of up to 40 police training advisers to support further development of the Timorese national police .
Their activities are primarily targeted at the specialized units of the Timorese police , which include the Police Reserve Unit , the Rapid Intervention Unit and the Marine Unit , in addition to the Border Patrol Unit.
Assistance is also being provided to the Professional Ethics Office , Crime Scene Office and Public Information Office of the national police and the immigration services , as well as in the areas of close protection , counter - terrorism and explosive ordnance disposal .
UNOTIL police training advisers provided three - dimensional support as : ( a ) field trainers providing on - the - job training ; ( b ) subject matter experts focusing on the training of trainers ; and ( c ) strategic planners who contribute to the strategic development of the Timorese police leadership by engaging them in the organizational planning process .
A specific training package was designed for the Rapid Intervention Unit , aimed at providing refresher training in crowd and riot control , use of force and human rights protection .
A standardized approach was adopted to ensure that the training provided conformed to similar programmes implemented by the Timorese Police Academy with support from bilateral partners such as Australia and the United Kingdom ( see para . 25 below ) .
UNOTIL police advisers attached to the immigration unit provided technical assistance in drafting the readmission agreement and in designing border - crossing passes .
In addition , they completed a training manual on immigration and safe handling of weapons , which was handed over to the Timorese police .
UNOTIL police advisers also helped to finalize an inter - government agency cooperation agreement , by which the immigration , customs and quarantine departments may assist the under - resourced Marine Unit in the task of conducting maritime surveillance of 700 km of coastal borders .
Finally , UNOTIL police training advisers assisted in the establishment and development of the counter - terrorism section within the intelligence section of the Timorese police .
All activities undertaken by UNOTIL police training advisers during the reporting period were closely coordinated with the relevant units of the Timorese police , in order to ensure the sustainability of police development efforts and facilitate local ownership of the process .
UNOTIL police training advisers also worked in close coordination with bilateral and multilateral partners to integrate and complement their respective efforts .
For example , UNOTIL police training advisers and the Timor - Leste Police Development Project , supported by Australia and the United Kingdom , jointly designed a four - week training programme for police station commanders which commenced on 25 July .
The UNOTIL police component also held regular meetings with interested donors to strengthen cooperation and plan integrated training initiatives for further development of the Timorese police .
As reported in paragraph 10 above , the second meeting of the consultative group , which took place on 26 July , addressed issues related to further development of the Timorese national police , including the Border Patrol Unit.
The meeting was attended , among others , by the General Commander of the national police and some 35 Timorese police officers , the Commander of the Border Security Task Force of the Indonesian army , Indonesian army officers from Kupang and Denpasar and UNOTIL police and military training advisers .
Agreement was reached on the need to develop the managerial leadership of the Timorese police ; improve the integration and coordination of bilateral and multilateral assistance to the police ; and enhance the accountability of the police and ensure effective border management by the Border Patrol Unit and the Indonesian army .
These goals will form an integral part of the strategy of the UNOTIL civilian police component in the coming months .
In an effort to further develop the capacity of the Timorese national police , a group of five Timorese police officers was recently selected to serve with the civilian police component of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo ( UNMIK ) .
These officers will be posted to work with their international counterparts in the Mission , alongside the Kosovo Police Service , in managerial and operational areas .
It is hoped that through their one - year assignment to UNMIK , the Timorese police officers will gain valuable experience , skills and knowledge which they can share with their national colleagues upon return to normal service with the national police of Timor - Leste .
Support for development of the Border Patrol Unit
With regard to UNOTIL assistance to the development of the Border Patrol Unit , the mandate provides for up to 35 additional advisers , of whom 15 may be military advisers .
As indicated in my previous report to the Security Council ( S /2005 /310 , para. 24 ) , the additional 20 positions are being filled by police training advisers .
The advisers are mandated , inter alia , to assist the Timorese police in developing procedures and training programmes for the Border Patrol Unit and to assist the Government in coordinating contacts with the Indonesian military , with the objective of enabling the Border Patrol Unit to assume full responsibility for such coordination as soon as possible .
A joint concept of operations was developed to ensure close cooperation between the police and the military training advisers tasked with further development of the Border Patrol Unit.
Joint operations and reporting mechanisms have been established at UNOTIL headquarters , where police and military training advisers plan and coordinate their activities in the three border sectors of Bobonaro , Cova Lima and Oecussi while maintaining regular contact with the Timorese national police headquarters .
Joint military and police training adviser teams are deployed to each of the three border sectors .
Military training advisers are primarily responsible for facilitating relations between the Border Patrol Unit and its Indonesian counterpart , while police training advisers provide training and mentoring to the Border Patrol Unit.
UNOTIL police and military advisers jointly visited all Border Patrol Unit posts , where they gave guidance to officers in the management of operational information and other aspects of their work .
Similar visits have commenced to all district headquarters of the Border Patrol Unit.
During the reporting period , UNOTIL military training advisers also finalized a border management training curriculum with detailed lesson plans to be implemented towards the end of August 2005 .
In accordance with their coordination role , UNOTIL military advisers supported several tactical - level meetings between the Border Patrol Unit and its Indonesian counterpart at various junction points along the border .
They also monitored the conduct of family meetings and , in cooperation with UNOTIL police advisers , supported direct negotiations between the Border Patrol Unit and the Indonesian army on the establishment of a new border management mechanism , which was discussed at the third meeting of the Joint Ministerial Commission , held in Jakarta on 7 and 8 July ( see para . 7 above ) .
At a fourth round of negotiations held at Motaain on 13 July , the Border Patrol Unit engaged in direct dialogue with the Indonesian army , reflecting the Unit 's increased competence and confidence .
Programme III Provision of training in observance of democratic governance and human rights
Security Council resolution 1599 ( 2005 ) authorizes the deployment of up to 10 human rights officers to provide training in the observance of democratic governance and human rights .
Following a request from the Government , six human rights officers have been assigned to various State institutions to provide direct assistance in the areas of human rights and democratic governance , while the remaining four officers are based at UNOTIL headquarters .
The primary objective of UNOTIL human rights officers is to assist State institutions in the development of long - term plans for human rights capacity - building , including through the continued transfer of skills and knowledge to national human rights officers .
In this respect , UNOTIL continued to work closely with UNDP and other relevant United Nations system actors in Timor - Leste , seeking to maximize the collective impact of various United Nations initiatives to build human rights capacity at the national , district and local levels .
During the reporting period , the UNOTIL Human Rights Unit focused , in particular , on building the institutional capacity of the newly established Office of the Provedor for Human Rights and Justice .
In order to maximize exposure to long - term institutional development assistance beyond the end of the Mission 's mandate , the Unit facilitated contacts between the Office of the Provedor and various regional and international human rights networks .
In addition , the Unit continued to support the development of the capacity of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation to discharge the reporting obligations for the various human rights treaties to which Timor - Leste is a party , and to assist in the completion of the final report of the Commission for Reception , Truth and Reconciliation , which is due to be published towards the end of September 2005 .
UNOTIL human rights officers also cooperated with the Ministry of the Interior through the provision of training on human rights and the use of force to the national police , including the Rapid Intervention and Police Reserve Units .
A “ training - of - trainers ” course was also implemented , providing 46 police trainers with in - depth knowledge of human rights , use of force , arrest and detention practices and interview techniques .
In addition , UNOTIL , in collaboration with the Government and the national police , launched a training manual on human rights designed for use in the instruction of police officers and new recruits .
Finally , the UNOTIL Human Rights Unit continued to review the human rights situation in the country , to ensure targeted assistance to State institutions and to contribute to the overall promotion and protection of human rights in Timor - Leste .
The Unit supported the development of non-governmental capacity for human rights monitoring , providing technical training on the establishment of a human rights database to five local human rights non-governmental organizations .
Role of the United Nations system
Despite significant progress towards the achievement of the goals laid out in the national development plan , Timor - Leste still has the lowest level of human development in East Asia and the Pacific and remains among the 20 poorest countries in the world .
Moreover , economic growth is expected to be modest in 2005 due to stagnant employment opportunities , a continued downsizing of the international presence and a decline in bilateral and multilateral assistance .
As potential revenues from oil and gas exploitation remain uncertain , the country will continue to depend on external assistance to finance its economic , social and human development and to reduce overall poverty .
The World Bank continued to administer the transition support programme , a multidonor grant - funded programme which contributed some $ 30 million to the national budget of Timor - Leste .
Since April 2005 , the programme has supported , inter alia , the rehabilitation of 10 market sites , the training of 354 new entrepreneurs , training programmes in entrepreneurship and financial management , the establishment of an electronic information centre for agriculture , and the completion of the national education policy framework .
The World Bank also continued to coordinate a consolidation support programme , a budget support programme which contributes some $ 10 million to $ 15 million to the national budget .
The budget support has primarily served to strengthen the capacity of staff in the Ministry of Planning and Finance , line ministries and districts , particularly in the areas of planning and financial management .
Increased support by the World Bank to institutional capacity - building in the finance sector , in close cooperation with IMF and other development partners , is expected to facilitate the transition from UNOTIL to a sustainable development assistance framework .
In addition , the Asian Development Bank has introduced a new development grants facility to finance the rehabilitation of roads , urban water supply and sanitation .
UNDP continued to focus on democratic governance . The UNDP Institutional Capacity Development Support Programme provided support to State institutions , including the National Parliament , while the UNDP Justice Sector Support Project focused on the training of judges , prosecutors and public defenders , in coordination with UNOTIL judicial advisers .
On 28 July , Brazil and UNDP launched a programme for the provision of four advisers to the judiciary sector , including one judge , one prosecutor and two public defenders .
At the local level , UNDP and the United Nations Capital Development Fund helped the Ministry of Internal Administration to pilot a decentralized government programme , under which seven local assemblies were established in Bobonaro district to serve as the centre for local planning and decision - making processes .
Together with the United Nations Office for Project Services , UNDP continued to implement community activation programmes , that help communities to start small - scale businesses .
Moreover , in cooperation with the International Labour Organization , UNDP began the implementation of the Skills Training for Gainful Employment Programme .
Meanwhile , the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization and the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) supported the national plan for non-formal education , which targets out - of - school youth and women in rural areas .
In anticipation of possible food shortages in the coming months , several initiatives have been undertaken to ensure effective coordination of food aid .
An inter-ministerial commission on food aid has been established , with the assistance of international food agencies and donors , to identify the areas that are most likely to be vulnerable to food shortages .
In accordance with a contingency plan to guarantee food security , the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , in cooperation with the Government , has begun to put in place strategic food reserves supplied by local purchase of rice from surplus production areas .
WFP and the Government also began to implement a mother and child health service and school feeding programmes in areas identified as disadvantaged .
Meanwhile , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) , in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture , Forestry and Fisheries and the Secretariat of State for Labour and Solidarity , launched a project providing agricultural inputs and training to help some 1,000 ex-combatants to resume their livelihood activities .
FAO also assisted the Ministry of Agriculture , Forestry and Fisheries in the development of an agricultural statistics system for the collection and analysis of agricultural sector data .
In the health sector , the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) supported the improvement of emergency obstetric care in district hospitals .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) continued to assist the Ministry of Health in strengthening the integration of disease surveillance and prevention and control of communicable diseases , such as malaria , tuberculosis and leprosy , in all 13 districts , while UNICEF helped the Ministry of Health to implement systematic outreach activities to support health services targeting mothers and children .
UNICEF also assisted the Government in complying with its reporting obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and , as of 21 May 2005 , took over a civilian adviser 's post at the Ministry of Education that was previously funded by UNMISET .
The United Nations Development Fund for Women ( UNIFEM ) provided training to 795 male and female candidates in the local elections and is developing a training programme for elected female officials in cooperation with the National Institute for Public Administration .
UNIFEM continued to support the Office for the Promotion of Equality , including in meeting its reporting obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women .
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) continued to encourage the development of national law and regulations for the protection of refugees and to support the enhancement of capacity of the Asylum Unit within the Department of Immigration .
Financial aspects
The initial operation of UNOTIL for the period from 21 May to 30 September 2005 is being funded under the provisions of General Assembly resolution 58/273 , on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses , and by using the savings achieved under other special political missions ' budgets .
A separate report presenting a full budget of UNOTIL for the period up to December 2005 is under preparation and will be submitted to the General Assembly at the beginning of its sixtieth session .
Similarly , requirements for UNOTIL for 2006 will be included in a consolidated report of the Secretary - General on estimates in respect of special political missions , good offices and other political initiatives authorized by the General Assembly and / or the Security Council , to be submitted to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session .
Observations
Since its establishment , UNOTIL has continued the efforts made by UNMISET over the past three years to strengthen the capacity of the Timorese State institutions and security forces .
In this respect , UNOTIL has focused on the transfer of skills and knowledge to further enhance the capacity of the Timorese public administration and national police to deliver the necessary services in accordance with established principles of democratic governance and human rights .
Special emphasis has been placed on the coordination of international assistance through the consultative group , which brings together a wide range of stakeholders , and through weekly policy review and coordination meetings , in order to ensure a smooth and rapid transition to a sustainable development assistance framework by the end of the UNOTIL mandate on 20 May 2006 .
During the reporting period , Timor - Leste has made further advances towards the threshold of self - sufficiency .
Progress has also been made in strengthening the country 's legal and institutional framework — including the adoption of a number of key pieces of legislation — which is expected to enhance democratic governance , promote respect for the rule of law and facilitate economic activities .
As a result of these positive developments , the reduction in the number of United Nations civilian advisers which accompanied the transition from UNMISET to UNOTIL has not had a negative impact on the Timorese public administration and has been largely offset by a review of the advisers ' competencies and distribution across the various State institutions , in an effort to respond more effectively to priority needs .
The 45 advisers who have been retained continue to provide key assistance to the further development of the Timorese finance sector , where lack of transparency and accountability could threaten the country 's long - term economic and social development .
Even more essential is the support which UNOTIL and UNDP continue to provide to the Timorese judiciary , which is unlikely to become fully self - sufficient before 2007 .
Although the support of UNOTIL to the training programme for national judges , prosecutors and defence lawyers is due to end in May 2006 , additional on - the - job training will need to be provided before the Timorese judicial personnel are able adequately to fulfil their functions without any international assistance .
UNOTIL police training advisers began implementation of an advanced training programme for the Timorese national police .
In this regard , it should be noted that although the skills and competencies of the Timorese police have been considerably enhanced , instances of excessive use of force and human rights violations by police officers , including against members of political opposition groups , continue to be reported .
Training in the observance of democratic governance and human rights , for members of the Timorese police and other Government officials , will remain an important priority for the remainder of the UNOTIL mandate .
The overall security situation remained calm , and relations between Timor - Leste and Indonesia continued to improve .
With continued support from the UNOTIL military training advisers , the Border Patrol Unit has begun to engage in direct dialogue with its Indonesian counterpart , which bodes well for their future interaction once the UNOTIL mandate comes to an end .
Timor - Leste and Indonesia have also recognized the importance of concluding a border management agreement by the end of the year .
The UNOTIL military training advisers will continue to provide both parties with the necessary support to finalize the agreement and establish a mechanism to facilitate the resolution of border incidents .
Despite consultations with neighbouring countries , UNOTIL has not been able to secure contingency arrangements to ensure the safety of its personnel .
As a result , UNOTIL would have to rely solely on civilian air assets for the evacuation of its staff in the event of an emergency .
Finally , the end of the UNMISET mandate brought the serious crimes process to a close .
Although the Serious Crimes Unit has made an important contribution to achieving justice , it was able to investigate fewer than half of the estimated 1,450 murders committed in 1999 .
In this connection , I would like to appeal to the Governments of Timor - Leste and Indonesia , and to the international community as a whole , to ensure that all those responsible for the serious crimes committed in 1999 are held accountable , so as to respond to the desire for justice of all those affected by the violence .
In conclusion , I would like to pay tribute to my Special Representative , Sukehiro Hasegawa , and to all the men and women of UNOTIL , for their dedicated efforts to discharge the mandate entrusted to the Mission by the Security Council .
Letter dated 4 April 2005 from the Permanent Representative of Rwanda to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council
I have the honour to transmit herewith a communiqué issued by the Government of the Republic of Rwanda at Kigali on Friday , 1 April 2005 , concerning the decision of the ex-FAR / Interahamwe ( FDLR / FOCA ) to disarm unconditionally and return to Rwanda ( see annex ) .
We request that the present letter and its annex be circulated to all members of the Security Council and that they also be issued as a document of the Security Council .
( Signed ) Stanislas Kamanzi Ambassador Permanent Representative
Annex to the letter dated 4 April 2005 from the Permanent Representative of Rwanda to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council
Communiqué issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Rwanda at Kigali on 1 April 2005
The Government of the Republic of Rwanda has received information that the ex-FAR / Interahamwe forces are now calling themselves FDLR / FOCA , currently operating in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo , have made the decision to unconditionally disarm and return to Rwanda .
The Government urges the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the international community to act with dispatch to make sure that the disarmament and return take place expeditiously , in fulfilment of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement of 1999 , the Pretoria agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda of 2002 and the decision of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union in its resolution of 10 January 2005 .
Rwanda welcomes the commitment of Sant' Egidio Community to join the international community in working for a speedy disarmament and demobilization of these groups .
The Government reiterates that the disarmament and demobilization of this group is long overdue , and reminds the international community that failure to do so has been the root cause of wars , conflict and persistent insecurity in the Great Lakes region .
It has also allowed the ex-FAR / Interahamwe to attempt to change identities while pursuing the same agenda over the last decade , calling themselves ALIR I , ALIR II and PALIR , and finally FDLR / FOCA , when the United States of America placed ALIR / PALIR on its list of international terrorists in the aftermath of the September 2001 Al - Qaida attack on the United States , in response to the massacre by ALIR / PALIR of Western tourists in Bwindi national park .
The Government is convinced that as the world prepares to commemorate the genocide of 1994 for the eleventh year , Rwandans deserve to have the threat of genocide removed from them once and for all .
The Government remains committed and ready to receive all former combatants who return to Rwanda , and to assist in their reintegration into Rwanda society .
Those Rwandans , who have spent the last decade roaming the forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the service of a misguided and criminal enterprise , deserve a better life and are called upon to join other Rwandans in the building of a better future for all .
The Government will spare no effort to assist them and all Rwandans in this noble endeavour .
Finally , while the Government understands the need of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to talk to these genocidal groups to cease their activities on Democratic Republic of the Congo territory and to disarm , the Government is gravely concerned by the information that the United Nations , the European Union and some countries plan to sit at the same table with a group that committed the last horrific genocide of the twentieth century .
Rwanda believes that such a course of action would be an indelible blot on the respect , honour and moral standing of the bodies and countries in question .
The Government is also gravely concerned that the political leadership of these groups is based in and has an official address in Belgium . This is unacceptable to the Rwandan people , and should be to the whole of humanity .
COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS Sixty - first session Item 18 ( b ) of the provisional agenda
Regional arrangements for the promotion and protection of human rights in the Asian and Pacific region
Note by the Secretariat
In its resolution 2004 / 74 , the Commission requested the Secretary - General to submit to it at its sixty - first session a report containing the conclusions of the thirteenth Workshop on Regional Cooperation for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in the Asian and Pacific Region and information on the progress achieved in the implementation of the resolution .
Following consultations with the host country , China , the thirteenth Annual Workshop , initially scheduled to take place from 1 to 4 February 2005 in Beijing , has been postponed for later in the year .
The main reason for the postponement is the fact that many countries of the region , particularly those that have been directly affected by the tsunami of 26 December 2004 , have given top priority to relief efforts for the populations concerned .
In particular , official confirmations of participants in the workshop , received by the Secretariat by the deadline of 7 January 2005 , were significantly lower than in previous years .
Under the circumstances , it was decided to postpone the workshop to later in the year to allow for more thorough preparations , including the thematic discussion on the issue of human rights and human trafficking .
In view of the above , the Secretariat wishes to inform the Commission on Human Rights that the Secretary - General 's report will be submitted to it at the conclusion of the thirteenth Annual Workshop .
Japan : draft resolution
Measures against newly emerging drugs and precursors not controlled under the international drug control treaties
The Commission on Narcotic Drugs ,
Recalling Economic and Social Council resolution 2004/41 of 21 July 2004 , on control of the manufacture of , trafficking in and abuse of synthetic drugs ,
Reaffirming its resolution 44/14 , in which it invited States and relevant regional organizations to foster the exchange of information on patterns of drug use and on substances consumed ,
Recalling its resolution 45/ 6 , in which it encouraged States to involve the pharmaceutical industry in increasing knowledge about the potential for abuse of and dependence on psychoactive substances ,
Recalling also its resolution 45/13 on optimizing systems for collecting information and identifying best practices to counter the demand for illicit drugs ,
Recalling further its resolution 46 / 7 , in which it urged States to implement its resolution 45/6 ,
Recalling further its resolution 47/1 ,
Recognizing that a number of drugs and precursors not controlled under the international drug control treaties have emerged in recent years in several regions throughout the world , as evidenced by the recent phenomenon of ketamine abuse in East and South - East Asia referred to in the report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 2004 ,
Recognizing the widespread abuse of those drugs , especially among young people , and diversion of those drugs and precursors into illicit channels ,
Deeply concerned that the abuse of those drugs and the diversion of those drugs and precursors may spread to the rest of the world in the near future ,
Concerned about the international distribution of those drugs and precursors by new means of illicit drug trading , including via the Internet , and the lack of harmonized national regulations to counter that development ,
Noting that , pursuant to article 39 of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 , article 23 of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 and article 24 of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 , parties to those conventions are not precluded from individually adopting domestic measures of control that are stricter than those provided for in those conventions ,
Aware of the difficulties encountered by Governments in their efforts to carry out prompt , effective drug control countermeasures in a manner that is in harmony with the efforts of other Governments , considering that new drugs and precursors are constantly emerging and that each Government has limited scientific knowledge of those substances ,
Noting that it is necessary to gather and share information on those drugs and precursors , in order to ensure the development of up - to - date international measures before the situation worsens , and to help Member States to cooperate more closely in tackling problems involving those substances by placing them under the control of the international drug control treaties ,
Calls upon Member States to submit information on newly emerging drugs and precursors to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime so that it may increase the knowledge available about those substances , such as the prevalence of their abuse , dependence and other health hazards and the synthetic techniques and diversion channels used , as well as information regarding administrative measures taken by Governments ;
Requests the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to play a central role in gathering from Member States information on newly emerging drugs and precursors and in sharing that information with other Member States , the International Narcotics Control Board and the World Health Organization ;
Requests the World Health Organization to review the information provided by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime on the drugs in question from a scientific and public health viewpoint and to communicate the results to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs so that the Commission may consider putting those drugs under the control of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 or the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 ;
Requests the International Narcotics Control Board to review the information provided by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime on the precursors in question from a technical viewpoint and to communicate the results to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs so that the Commission may consider putting those precursors under the control of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 ;
Urges Member States to initiate the procedure for placing the drugs and precursors in question under international control , in order to facilitate efforts to carry out drug control measures in an effective and harmonized manner , and to cooperate more closely with other Member States in tackling problems involving such substances ;
Encourages Member States to take preventive measures to control latent precursors that may be converted into drugs liable to abuse before those precursors are placed under the control of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 .

Comprehensive review of the implementation of the
Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development
of Small Island Developing States
Summaries of panel discussions
Note by the Secretariat
Addendum
Panel two Special challenges facing small island developing States in trade and economic development ( Tuesday , 11 January 2005 , 10 a.m. - 1 p.m. )
Summary of discussion prepared by the Chairperson
Panel two addressed the topic of the special challenges facing small island developing States in trade and economic development .
The panel was chaired by Jaya Krishna Cuttaree , Minister of Foreign Affairs , International Trade and Regional Cooperation of Mauritius .
Habib Ouane , Director of the Special Programme on the Least Developed Countries , Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States , United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) , was the moderator .
The five panellists were Anthony Severin , Ambassador Plenipotentiary and Extraordinary in the Office of the Prime Minister of Saint Lucia and Saint Lucia 's Ambassador to the Caribbean Community ; Mohamed Latheef , Permanent Representative of Maldives to the United Nations ; Hans - Peter Werner , Counsellor , Development Division of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) ; Sivaramen Palayathan , Trade Adviser , Permanent Mission of Mauritius to WTO ; and Deep Ford , Senior Trade Adviser , Commodities and Trade Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations .
The panellists ' presentations were followed by an interactive debate .
The panel 's recommendations are being presented to the high - level round tables to stimulate the intergovernmental dialogue on concrete measures to advance the small island developing States agenda , and will be included in the report of the International Meeting .
The panel covered three main topics , including economic , vulnerability , trade issues as they relate to small island developing States and the institutional responses to address these challenges .
The panel recommended actions for further consideration .
Economic vulnerability issues
Small island developing States have open , small - scale economies with limited resources , and are highly dependent on external markets and resources .
In addition , they suffer from many structural and competitive disadvantages .
Most small island developing States specialize in a narrow range of products and have a limited domestic market .
Several are single commodity exporters and rely heavily on export earnings .
This external dependence increases their vulnerability to external economic threats and shocks .
There was an urgent call by participants for action to avoid further marginalization of small island developing States .
It was noted that issues of diseconomies of scale are directly related to high - unit costs of producing goods and services , which result in non-competitive prices .
This is exacerbated by high transportation costs due to the geographical remoteness of small island developing States .
In addition , small island developing States commonly have difficulties to access capital , including from multilateral financial institutions .
Globalization has further marginalized small island developing States in the global market .
Several speakers emphasized that the current rule for graduation from least developed country status , an issue of critical importance to small island developing States , requires re-examination .
Small island developing States that would graduate from least developed country status would become , in a relatively short time , ineligible for concessionary or preferential treatment , which would severely restrict their ability to recover , for example , from natural disasters and economic shocks to which they are particularly vulnerable .
This issue was illustrated by the example of Maldives , which recently faced the consequences of a tsunami disaster .
Special support measures would be necessary to allow small island developing States to adapt to the circumstances that would follow graduation .
Trade - related issues
Participants noted that consideration of small island developing States is a relatively new feature in international trade negotiations .
It was stressed that the rule - based multilateral trading system ought to take into consideration the special economic disadvantages of small island developing States .
The latter are often weak trading partners and face serious difficulties in competing in international trade .
The European Union trading system was cited as a successful model with regard to granting special and differential treatment to weaker and smaller economies . This has allowed such countries as Greece and Portugal to make structural adjustment to the global economy and fully integrate into the multilateral trading system .
Future trade negotiations should make the multilateral trading system more equitable through recognition of the particular disadvantages of small island developing States .
This would allow small island developing States to engage on a more equal footing in international trade , gain more secure access to external markets and participate as equal partners in WTO negotiations .
Mauritius illustrated the need for a preferential and differentiated treatment of small island developing States that export commodities .
The example of the recent EU reform concerning sugar was cited .
That reform brought down the prices of sugar by about 37 per cent , and could lead to the demise of the sugar sector in Mauritius .
It was noted that international trade negotiations in WTO are pursued under the Doha development agenda , which includes specific provisions concerning trade - related issues relevant to small and vulnerable economies .
It was also noted that negotiations , particularly those relating to the preferential treatment of small island developing States , access to markets and agricultural subsidies , have not advanced in the manner that was hoped for at the time of the adoption of the Doha ministerial declaration in 2001 .
Institutional responses to relevant issues
Participants generally took the view that small island developing States will not be able to build economic resilience and competitive economies without the support of their development partners .
Increased aid flows from bilateral development partners and multilateral financial institutions are essential for enhancing resilience capacities .
There is also a need to intensify economic cooperation within small island developing States regions , including through the pooling of resources . United Nations agencies should continue to help in this regard .
Institutional capacity - building is of critical importance to small island developing States .
Several small island developing States have made strides in developing their capacity to trade , but economic vulnerabilities remain high and special efforts should be made by the international community to strengthen the resilience of these countries .
It is important to identify practical ways for capacity - building and regional approaches and strategies for supporting the economic development of small island developing States , with the assistance of international development partners .
The complexity of trade negotiations and the related challenges faced by small island developing States justify the efforts to develop the negotiating capacities of small island developing States .
They also imply innovative approaches on the part of small island developing States .
It was noted that the fear that a special treatment of small island developing States might undermine the multilateral trading system was unfounded .
Recommended actions for further consideration
• Assist small island developing States in enhancing their competitiveness in international markets .
• Ensure that the rule - based multilateral trading system properly takes into consideration the economic vulnerabilities of small island developing States .
• Implement the provisions of the Doha ministerial declaration that are relevant to the differential and preferential treatment of small island developing States , particularly those regarding access to external markets .
• Set up innovative financial mechanisms to respond to the structural disadvantages of small island developing States .
• Improve the capacity of small island developing States to effectively participate in WTO negotiations .
• Strengthen the institutional capacities of small island developing States , including their capacity to develop trade - related policies and relevant regulatory measures .
• Make success stories of small island developing States in economic development and capacity - building available for learning purposes .
• Strengthen South - South cooperation relevant to small island developing States through regional entities , with the support of developed countries and international organizations .
• Re-examine the rule for graduation from least developed country status in the light of the special vulnerabilities of small island developing States .
• Increase the scope for acceptance of small island developing States as a case for special treatment in WTO .
• Invite relevant United Nations bodies to give the United Nations list of small island developing States formal status for the purposes of special treatment .
Human Rights Committee
Eighty - third session
Summary record of the 2265th meeting
Held at Headquarters , New York , on Monday , 21 March 2005 , at 3 p.m.
Chairperson : Ms. Chanet
Contents
Consideration of reports submitted by States parties under article 40 of the Covenant and of country situations ( continued )
Second periodic report of Uzbekistan
The meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.
Consideration of reports submitted by States parties under article 40 of the Covenant and of country situations ( continued )
Second periodic report of Uzbekistan ( CCPR / C/83/L / UZB and CCPR / C / UZB / 2004 / 2 ; HRI / CORE/1/Add.129 )
At the invitation of the Chairperson , the delegation of Uzbekistan took places at the Committee table .
Mr. Saidov ( Uzbekistan ) said that his Government had taken a number of steps to implement the provisions of the Covenant .
Over the past year Uzbekistan had become a party to over 60 international human rights instruments , including six United Nations treaties .
Parliament had adopted over 50 laws regulating civil and political rights , a case in point being a new law broadening the scope of the Ombudsman .
In fulfilment of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , an institutional base for protecting civil and political rights had been established , including a parliamentary Ombudsman , a Constitutional Court and a National Centre for Human Rights .
As part of the United Nations Decade for Human Rights , a human rights course had been introduced in all schools and universities .
In the framework of the United Nations global information campaign , over 100 international legal texts on human rights had been translated into Uzbek .
Nevertheless , a range of problems continued to impinge on the state of human rights in Uzbekistan , mostly in relation to the justice system .
Human rights mechanisms and procedures were only then being established ; the notion of the rule of law was almost non-existent among law enforcement personnel ; and the population had scant knowledge of human rights issues , a situation associated with the rapid changes that had occurred in the legal system since independence .
However , Uzbekistan was cooperating with various United Nations bodies in a number of areas .
It had already presented six reports to United Nations treaty bodies .
To date , Uzbekistan had implemented fully 18 of the 22 recommendations of the Commission on Human Rights Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , and was providing the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights with technical cooperation in the sphere of human rights in Central Asia .
A United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) human rights project for 2003 - 2006 was focused on increasing partnerships between the Government and non-governmental organizations .
Activities over the previous year had included consultations between the main investigative body of the Ministry of the Interior and the human rights organization Freedom House , aimed at improving the dialogue between the Government and civil society , and a three - day symposium on the implementation of human rights instruments and programmes , as well as monitoring and training activities .
The Ministry of the Interior had requested assistance from UNDP in providing human rights training for its staff , and 20 employees had thus far received training in such areas as international standards of arrest , detention , prevention of torture and investigative methods .
Human rights libraries had been set up . Non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) were also being encouraged to take up the cause of human rights , and their number currently totalled over 5,000 , twice the figure in 2000 .
With regard to the criminal justice system , a totally new concept of justice and the legal system was being implemented .
Several new measures to ensure the independence of the courts had been introduced : courts specializing in criminal , civil and commercial matters had been established , and a democratic mechanism for selecting judicial personnel had been put in place .
Judicial procedures were being streamlined and citizens were being afforded greater access to the courts . Classifications of crimes had been thoroughly revised and many categories of crimes were no longer punishable by incarceration .
Prison conditions were being improved . The Government was preparing a habeas corpus bill , and intended to move towards abolishing the death penalty .
The Chairperson welcomed the large number of non-governmental organizations in attendance , especially those from Tashkent .
She invited the delegation to address the list of issues ( CCPR / C/83 /L / UZB ) .
Constitutional and legal framework within which the Covenant is implemented .
Right to an effective remedy ( article 2 of the Covenant )
Mr. Saidov ( Uzbekistan ) , referring to question 1 on the list of issues , said that in the criminal case involving Arsen Arutyunyan , the latter 's prison sentence , which had begun in June 1999 , had been reduced from 20 to 6 years .
Following a Presidential Decree of 26 September 2003 on the liberalization of prison sentences for first - time offenders , Mr. Arutyunyan had been transferred to an ordinary - regime colony .
Mr. Sharafutdinov ( Uzbekistan ) , referring to question 2 , said that with regard to the 31 death penalty cases currently being reviewed by the Committee , in 15 cases the death sentence had been implemented before his Government had received the Committee 's requests ; in 7 cases the sentences had been commuted ; and in 9 cases the death sentences had been suspended pending review of the appeals before the Presidential Pardon Commission .
Currently the death sentence was applicable to only two categories of crime — aggravated homicide and terrorism , which together constituted 0.7 per cent of all crimes .
The death penalty was not applicable to women , juveniles and men over 60 years of age .
Not even genocide was punishable by death , the maximum punishment being 10 to 20 years ' deprivation of liberty .
Those condemned to death could receive monthly visits from relatives .
Condemned persons could appeal for clemency and such requests were sent to the Presidential Pardon Commission for review .
In January 2005 there had been discussions in Parliament on abolishing the death penalty and replacing it with long prison sentences .
Equality between the sexes and non-discrimination ( articles 3 and 26 of the Covenant
Mr. Saidov ( Uzbekistan ) , referring to question 3 , said that gender equality was a top priority for his Government .
Recent laws had set a 30 per cent quota for women candidates to Parliament .
In the recent parliamentary elections , 162 out of 600 registered candidates had been women , a figure which surpassed the 30 per cent quota .
The results of the 2004 elections showed a threefold increase in the percentage of women elected to Parliament as compared with 1994 .
The number of women in official positions was also increasing : the Deputy Chairman of the Senate , the Deputy Speaker of the lower house of Parliament , the Ombudsman , and the Deputy Prime Minister were all women .
Every village , city and provincial administration had a deputy head , who was usually a woman .
There had also been a dramatic increase in the number of women 's non-governmental organizations .
Referring to question 4 , he said that sexual assault against women and minors and various forms of sexual coercion , including trafficking , were punishable under the Criminal Code .
The Government had established a committee to monitor the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women .
Parliament was considering other laws to ensure gender equality .
Women 's non-governmental organizations were helping to change attitudes towards women in society through gender research , outreach efforts and cooperation with international organizations .
Derogations ( article 4 of the Covenant )
Mr. Saidov ( Uzbekistan ) , referring to question 5 , said that in the event of a declaration of a state of emergency , his Government would be guided by the following principles : humanism and the primacy of human life and health ; transparency ; timeliness and accuracy of information ; and early warning and preventive measures .
Legislation adopted in 2000 governed civil defence procedures , the authority of State bodies and the rights of citizens during emergencies .
Right to life ( article 6 of the Covenant ) ; freedom from torture , treatment of prisoners and other detainees ( articles 7 and 10 of the Covenant )
In response to question 6 , Mr. Sharafutdinov ( Uzbekistan ) said that although the number of people who had been sentenced to death and the number of sentences carried out were a State secret in accordance with a 1994 government decree , he could describe general trends with respect to the death penalty .
The number of death sentences carried out since the consideration of the initial periodic report had steadily decreased .
In 2001 the number of death sentences carried out had decreased by 35.8 per cent from the previous year ; in 2002 by 54.7 per cent ; in 2003 by 17.9 per cent ; and in 2004 , by 53.1 per cent .
Between 2000 and 2004 the number of death sentences carried out had been reduced almost ninefold .
Between 2002 and 2004 , 32 persons on death row had had their sentences commuted .
In accordance with criminal procedure , any sentence or court decision must be based on relevant , substantiated and admissible evidence .
The issues related to the requirements for such decisions had repeatedly been taken up by the Supreme Court , which had put forward appropriate recommendations that must be implemented by judicial bodies and law enforcement agencies involved in the discovery and investigation of crimes .
In 2004 , for example , the Supreme Court had adopted a decision on the application of the Code of Criminal Procedure stating that evidence obtained unlawfully or through coercion was inadmissible .
The Ministry of Internal Affairs , the Procurator 's Office and the National Security Service were all implementing that decision .
Concerning question 7 , he said that in accordance with a government plan of action to implement the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment would allow appropriate information to be provided to the relatives of persons sentenced to death ; relevant legislation would be transmitted to the legislative branch for consideration .
Legislation on declassifying death penalty procedures would also be sent to Parliament .
Parliament was still reviewing the issue of abolishing the death penalty .
Mr. Saidov ( Uzbekistan ) added that , based on the recommendations of the Committee , the law on State secrets was under review .
Furthermore , under article 137 of the Code for the Execution of Criminal Penalties , persons sentenced to death had the right to visits by clergy members .
With respect to question 8 , Mr. Sharafutdinov ( Uzbekistan ) said that cases of detainees who had died in custody were carefully investigated .
Medical experts were appointed to determine the cause of death and appropriate action was taken as a result of the medical report .
In addition to a mandatory investigation by the Procurator 's Office , an official investigation was carried out by a special division of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and , where necessary , law enforcement experts were called in to assist in the investigation .
A special commission of inquiry established to investigate the prison deaths of Andrei Shelkovenko and Samandar Umarov in cooperation with independent foreign experts had concluded that no unwarranted methods had been applied to the detainees .
Mr. Shelkovenko had died by hanging himself and Mr. Umarov had died of natural causes .
Before the investigation was completed , the news media had reported that Shelkovenko was yet another victim of torture in Uzbekistan .
The inquiry showed , however , that no torture had been involved in their deaths , and that had been reported by the foreign experts at a press conference .
Human rights groups had also been actively involved in the investigation into the cause of Mr. Umarov 's death and had expressed their views .
Mr. Saidov ( Uzbekistan ) , referring to question 9 , said that the new version of article 235 of the Criminal Code on penalties for the use of torture , which brought Uzbek legislation into line with article 1 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , had been effective .
In 2004 there had been 330 complaints by citizens of abuse by law enforcement officials .
Of those complaints , 79 had been confirmed and appropriate measures had been taken against the offenders .
Fourteen of them had been convicted under section 235 of the Criminal Code of using torture .
The Special Rapporteur 's recommendation concerning torture by members of official bodies had been complied with , because all three branches of Government had condemned the use of torture .
They included the President 's adviser , the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Procurator 's Office .
Concerning question 10 , Mr. Sharafutdinov ( Uzbekistan ) said that following the Special Rapporteur 's visit to Uzbekistan , the latter 's recommendations on the question of torture had been used as a basis for drafting human rights legislation and governmental decisions .
The Cabinet of Ministers had subsequently adopted an action plan for 2004 - 2005 to implement the Convention against Torture .
The plan incorporated all 22 recommendations of the Special Rapporteur .
Several practical and organizational measures included in the plan had been implemented : the most prominent included amendments to article 235 of the Criminal Code with the addition of an article on the use of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading punishment .
That article specified the penalties against officials , including investigators , interrogators , prosecutors and other law enforcement personnel , for any mistreatment of criminal suspects , their family members or witnesses , aimed at eliciting information or confessions of a crime .
The Code for the Execution of Criminal Penalties had also been amended to enhance the personal safety of convicted persons and procedures had been established for prisoners to appeal to the prison administration in the event that they were concerned about their safety .
State monitoring of the implementation of legislation against torture in places of detention and execution was carried out by the Procurator 's Office .
In order to ensure independent monitoring of prisons , legislation was planned to strengthen parliamentary oversight through the human rights Ombudsman .
Furthermore , 90 doctors had been trained in detecting the use of torture and other forms of ill - treatment in prisons .
Every detainee received full medical care and was examined for evidence of ill - treatment .
A presidential decree of March 2005 on reform and further liberalization of the legal and judicial system reflected the aforementioned plan of action to implement the Convention against Torture .
The reform had five objectives .
The first was regulating procedures for the detention of suspects and their placement in custody .
Studies had shown that the majority of infringements on the law , including torture of detainees , occurred while suspects were held in custody and law enforcement officers attempted to obtain information or a confession .
Therefore , the Ministry of Internal Affairs had issued an order in 2003 on provisional detention of suspects , guaranteeing a medical examination .
In 2004 , regulatory acts concerning law enforcement agencies had prohibited the detention of any suspect on the basis of false or uncorroborated evidence .
Efforts were being made to raise the level of human rights awareness among law enforcement agencies through training and education , including a booklet on criminal procedure , published in cooperation with UNDP .
The second objective concerned criminal procedure , including the timely reading to persons under arrest of their rights , the provision of legal counsel and notification of the immediate family members of detainees .
Those measures were also a substantial means of preventing the torture of detainees .
In 2003 , the Ministry of Internal Affairs , in conjunction with the Bar Association of Azerbaijan , had approved regulations to safeguard the right of defence of detainees , suspects and accused persons .
The regulations provided for the strict round - the - clock availability of defence lawyers , which addressed the concern expressed by the Special Rapporteur about the need for independent counsel and the practice of having defence lawyers work hand in hand with the prosecution .
They also established the opportunity for persons held in custody to obtain legal counsel within at least two hours of their arrest and procedures for their lawyers to lodge formal complaints of any violations during their detention .
Most important , judicial oversight had been instituted over law enforcement bodies to protect the rights of detainees , which would serve as a system of checks and balances against coercive procedures .
The third objective was to ensure independent investigations of alleged ill - treatment by law enforcement agencies .
Under the new procedures , any evidence of abuse was transmitted to the Procurator 's Office for appropriate action .
In cases involving the death of detainees , an investigation was carried out by the Procurator 's Office , whose approval was required before any burial of the deceased or issuance of a death certificate was permitted .
Any violations of the procedures were punishable by strict penalties .
Therefore , claims that his Government did not undertake adequate investigations of torture allegations were unfounded .
Such independent investigations , however , were not yet regulated by law .
Therefore , the investigations into the deaths of Mr. Shelkovenko and Mr. Umarov constituted precedents that were paving the way for the establishment of the relevant legislation .
In December 2004 , for example , the Ministry of Internal Affairs , together with the Ombudsman , had concluded an agreement on cooperation to ensure the monitoring of human rights and compliance with the law by the internal affairs agencies .
The fourth objective was to promote transparency in the law enforcement agencies .
Unfortunately , insufficient attention had been paid to the issue in the past while Uzbekistan was striving to build a democracy , but his Government had begun to take steps towards involving civil society in monitoring the activities of law enforcement agencies , including the establishment of a “ Rapid Reaction Group ” to respond effectively to any violations reported by human rights activists .
The fifth objective was to raise the level of human rights awareness among law enforcement agencies .
Special attention had been given to testing officials in that respect and to providing further training for senior officials .
Efforts were also under way to establish a certification procedure for the heads of the internal affairs agencies with regard to their knowledge of human rights and the law .
To achieve the goals set forth by the Special Rapporteur would require providing education for the law enforcement agencies so that every officer would recognize the need to comply with the law and respect human rights .
In other words , there was an urgent need to change ways of thinking , without which reform would be impossible .
Referring to question 11 , Mr. Saidov ( Uzbekistan ) said that extradition , expulsion and return were regulated by bilateral agreements , usually judicial assistance treaties , that Uzbekistan had concluded with other States .
Any extradition must be in keeping with the legislation of both parties to the agreement and must involve a crime punishable in both States by imprisonment of one year or more .
Extradition could be refused if the person in question was a citizen of Uzbekistan or had been granted asylum there ; if the request for extradition was based merely on an individual victim 's claim against the person concerned ; if the prosecution of the crime or the imposition of the sentence in question was time - barred ; if the request would involve an instance of double jeopardy ; or if the crime had been committed by a national of the other State in the territory of Uzbekistan .
Extradition could certainly be refused if there was a serious possibility that the person in question would be tortured in the requesting State ; as indicated in the report , there was no law on the matter , but the relevant norms of international law could be invoked .
With regard to question 12 on conditions of detention , the Government had sent copies of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners to all penal institutions .
Food rations in prison were regulated by a 2002 Cabinet of Ministers decision , and they varied according to the age of the prisoner , the seriousness of the crime committed and other considerations .
A minimum of 2,000 calories daily was standard , but prisoners could receive more on medical grounds .
There had been a liberalization of the rules governing the payment detainees received for work performed in prison and their right to family visits , parcels and telephone calls .
A presidential decree had liberalized the rules for sentencing first - time offenders to prison , cutting the number of arrests in half since 1999 , and had also revised the Criminal Code by classifying a number of crimes more leniently , thus easing the sentences of about 6,000 convicts and transferring thousands to less harsh institutions , or releasing them altogether .
While the number of some petty crimes had increased , there had been an overall decline in serious crime in the country .
Eighty per cent of detainees were being paid close to the minimum wage for doing useful work while serving their sentences .
Since 1999 , conditions in the prisons had been inspected by representatives of the Oliy Majlis , or Parliament , and by national non-governmental organizations .
Uzbekistan now had one of the most transparent penitentiary systems in the world : all prisons were open for both national and international inspection — not the case years earlier — and , indeed , since 2001 the International Committee of the Red Cross had made repeated visits , as had representatives of the European Parliament , several European Governments , the United States of America , the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey and also correspondents from the major United States and European press agencies .
Jaslyk prison in Karakalpakstan — which like the whole Central Asian region was still suffering from the Aral Sea tragedy and regularly experienced extremes of heat and cold — had been visited by the United States Ambassador accompanied by a Freedom House representative , and by the Independent Expert of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Uzbekistan .
Moreover , a national commission had been set up composed of representatives of the Procurator 's Office , the Ombudsman , the National Centre for Human Rights and the Ministry of Internal Affairs , to inspect conditions there first - hand and to identify any instances of torture or ill - treatment .
It had been determined that the prison met international requirements for space , food and medical services .
Road access to Jaslyk was being improved , and the Government was planning to expand hospital facilities , build hotel - type accommodations for long family visits , provide a well - stocked library and athletic fields , and offer training for individual activities .
Security of the person and protection from arbitrary arrest ( article 9 of the Covenant )
Mr. Sharafutdinov ( Uzbekistan ) , referring to questions 13 and 14 on the list of issues , said that pursuant to the National Plan of Action to Combat Torture , the Ministry of Justice was currently considering a draft regulation that would improve the conditions of police custody and pre-trial detention , and the President himself had urged Parliament in January 2005 to revise the legal provisions governing the holding of suspects to give the courts greater control of pre-trial procedures .
The National Centre for Human Rights had been considering the institution of habeas corpus since 2003 and , following an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe / UNDP / United States Lawyers Association round table on legal reform , proposals had been made to the Ministry of Justice for the introduction of habeas corpus and the revision of the Criminal Code to bring it into line with international standards , including those of the Covenant .
In 2004 , the Ministry had put out a report on the issue and set up a working group , of which he himself was a member , to propose legal reforms and strengthen court control over investigations and over the Procurator 's Office .
The group had agreed that suspects should not be held in custody for as long as 72 hours , and he himself was a proponent of the British system of a 24 - hour time limit with a possible 12 - hour extension .
The working group had prepared a draft proposal and was now working on the financial implications of the proposed changes before its submission to Parliament .
The application of habeas corpus alone would require overhauling the court system , because it would require many more judges than the 1 per 25,000 inhabitants currently in place .
Non-governmental organizations had been actively involved from the outset in making proposals to improve the rules and reform the court system in general , and all citizens interested in those human rights questions could make their voices heard .
Mr. Saidov ( Uzbekistan ) said , regarding the ongoing debate about removing the entire penitentiary system from the control of the Ministry of Internal Affairs , that some in the Government had argued for making no change , others for its transfer to the Ministry of Justice , and others for putting the system under the direct control of the Cabinet of Ministers because prison issues related to employment as well as the administration of justice .
The legal and financial aspects had to be considered along with the need to train law enforcement officials in new procedures .
The Chairperson invited the members of the Committee to ask questions on the replies to the first part of the list of issues .
Mr. Wieruszewski , observing that the report was timely and much richer than Uzbekistan 's initial report , welcomed the statement that non-governmental organizations were free to speak out on humanitarian issues .
With regard to question 1 on the list of issues , he noted that the delegation had failed to say anything about the procedures in place for the implementation of the Committee 's Views under the Optional Protocol .
So far , the Committee had ruled on three cases involving Uzbekistan , and it was unclear who in the Government made the decisions on compliance with Views .
A reply had been received on the Nazarov case ; that very day , the Government had given a delayed response to the Committee 's ruling in the Arutyunyan case : and as yet no reply had been received on the Hudayberganova case .
The Government 's reply on Mr. Arutyunyan , however , made no reference to the Committee 's recommendation for a further reduction of his term of imprisonment and for compensation to be paid , and it was unsatisfactory .
With regard to question 2 , it was a very serious breach of Uzbekistan 's obligations under the Optional Protocol to have executed many of the death - row prisoners who had petitioned the Committee — at least 15 per cent of them , by the delegation 's own account .
The Committee had called strongly for interim measures of protection for all of them .
Fortunately the Government now seemed to be taking the matter more seriously and had apparently granted a stay of execution in the case of nine of the remaining petitioners .
He asked the delegation to confirm , however , that Mr. Tolipkhuzhaev specifically had received a stay , since the Committee had received an unconfirmed NGO report that the petitioner had in fact been executed in early March 2005 .
To continue carrying out such executions would seriously undermine the credibility of the State party and its oral assertions about compliance with international norms .
It had been encouraging to hear the improvements made in connection with questions 3 and 4 on women 's rights , but domestic violence , for social and cultural reasons , still seemed to be a problem .
He wondered if the Government kept official statistics on violence against women , because the failure to do so would hamper any effort to improve the situation ; if it was working to develop services for victims of violence and trafficking ; if it had taken an official position criminalizing polygamy , a clear violation of article 3 of the Covenant , and had done anything to equalize the marriage age for men and women ; and if it was doing anything to punish those guilty of rape and other sexual crimes , who appeared still to enjoy impunity .
Also , he asked if the Government had done anything to revise article 120 of its Criminal Code , which criminalized homosexuality and had been the basis for many prosecutions , in clear violation of article 26 of the Covenant , which protected against discrimination on the grounds of sex .
Sir Nigel Rodley said that he wished to know precisely what information was being given to the families of persons sentenced to death , how far that practice had developed and how much remained to be done .
It was unclear whether the State party was taking steps to inform both condemned persons and their families about the exact date of execution and place of burial , as it had been requested to do .
The Committee had made it very clear at the last review that the failure to inform condemned persons and their families properly was a violation of the Covenant , particularly article 7 .
As for the State party 's claim that 18 of the 22 recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture had been fully implemented , he was curious to know which four recommendations had not , in its view , been fully implemented .
Moreover , he doubted that two recommendations specifically mentioned by the State party had been fully implemented , as claimed .
For example , a statement by a presidential adviser to diplomats and foreign journalists did not , in his view , constitute the kind of high - level statement publicly condemning torture in all its forms that had been recommended by the Special Rapporteur ; it seemed to be aimed at keeping people outside the country happy , rather than sending a strong message to judicial and law enforcement officials inside the country .
In addition , although the President had promised to make such a statement at a meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in 2003 , he had failed to do so .
Lastly , despite the Special Rapporteur 's recommendation that the definition of torture adopted should be fully consistent with the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , the actual definition was so far removed from the Convention that the Supreme Court had been required to state that it would be enforced in accordance with the Convention .
He welcomed the information that lawyers were now present during investigations and that denial of access to legal counsel was severely punished .
However , he wished to know whether any measures had been taken against investigators in the cases of Mr. Shelkovenko and Mr. Karimov , both of whom had been held for over 50 days without access to legal counsel .
The Committee had specifically requested statistics on investigations and prosecutions in respect of ill - treatment by State officials .
In view of the State party 's comment that training was still required , he wished to know what measures had been taken in that regard .
While he welcomed the State party 's decision to seek external assistance in investigating suspicious deaths in detention , particularly in view of its lack of resources , the Committee wished to know exactly how many such deaths had been investigated by outside experts .
In particular , the State party should clarify whether all the cases brought to the Committee 's attention had been investigated , or only the two mentioned .
Lastly , he wished to know when the legislation on the establishment of habeas corpus , which the President had submitted to Parliament in January 2005 , would enter into force .
Mr. Kälin , while acknowledging that progress had been made in reducing the number of detainees , redefining serious offences and declaring that confessions obtained by torture were inadmissible , said there still seemed to be a gap between the picture painted by the State party and the situation on the ground , as reported by NGOs , United Nations special procedures and the media .
He reiterated that the execution of 15 people in relation to whom the Committee had issued interim protection measures was a serious violation of the State party 's international obligations .
Such measures had nothing to do with the granting of clemency or a moratorium on the death penalty .
Article 1 of the Optional Protocol clearly stated that a State party to the Optional Protocol recognized the competence of the Committee to receive and consider communications from individuals subject to its jurisdiction .
The Committee could not consider communications if the individual concerned was no longer alive .
Other human rights courts and the International Court of Justice had taken a similar approach , indicating that interim protection measures were binding and that non-observation of such measures was a serious violation of international law .
He had taken note of the State party 's legislative provisions regarding emergencies and civil defence ; nonetheless , the State party had not answered the question regarding the non-derogable nature of the rights listed in article 4 , paragraph 2 , of the Covenant .
Moreover , article 93 , paragraph 15 , of the Constitution on the declaration of states of emergency made no reference to article 4 .
He asked the State party to specify how domestic legislation guaranteed that requirement in the event of a state of emergency .
In its reply concerning expulsion , return or extradition to States where there was compelling evidence to suggest that a person might be tortured , the State party had basically reiterated what was in the report , whereas the Committee had asked whether the State party intended to adopt new regulations explicitly prohibiting such measures .
While welcoming the State party 's detailed reply concerning prison conditions , he would appreciate further clarification concerning its worrying statement that food rations could be significantly reduced for persons accused of serious offences .
Ms. Wedgwood welcomed the fact that the delegation comprised high - ranking government officials , as that would ensure that the Committee 's comments were not overlooked in the process of transmittal .
She was , however , puzzled by the State party 's reluctance to provide statistics on the number of death sentences carried out , as requested by the Committee , and failed to understand why such statistics were a State secret .
In the light of the new legislation and the reduction in the number of capital offences , she wondered whether any persons convicted under the old legislation had been given more liberal sentences .
With regard to the length of time that a suspect could be held in custody without access to counsel , she reiterated that the longer a person was hidden from public view , the greater the temptation to apply excess force , hence the reason for the 24 - hour rule .
She wondered whether the State party had taken any steps to discourage the mistreatment of detainees ; in particular , had it transferred or suspended any public officials indicted for abuse or torture , as recommended by the Special Rapporteur ?
Did it allow the Ombudsman round - the - clock access to detention centres ? Was a prosecutor on duty to monitor the behaviour of law enforcement authorities ? The State party should also provide information on the number of persons prosecuted for torture and the number of victims awarded civil damages .
As for the intention to exact a law establishing habeas corpus , she wondered why it was not possible to follow the example of the United Kingdom and Israel and impute habeas corpus through an interpretation of existing administrative law , there by removing the need for a separate statute .
She was particularly concerned at the State party 's comment that it would not be able to afford habeas corpus until it had additional resources , as that could take a long time .
She was also concerned about reports from human rights groups that people incarcerated on mental health grounds had initially been arrested for being political dissidents ; she asked whether people arrested on mental health grounds had any way of challenging their incarceration or whether they , too , had to wait for a habeas corpus statute .
Lastly , she would be grateful for information as to whether someone could be arrested without a warrant in Uzbekistan and , if so , whether any steps had been taken to minimize such occurrences .
Lastly , she was concerned about the reference to incarceration regimes .
While she understood that prison conditions varied depending on the threat posed by inmates , it was unacceptable for prisons to deliberately maintain poor conditions for punitive purposes , as seemed to be the case in Uzbekistan .
Mr. Shearer said that he , too , wished to know exactly how many executions had been carried out .
It seemed extraordinary that such matters were considered a State secret when plenty of other information was available .
Keeping such information secret amounted to a total lack of transparency and would prevent people both inside and outside the country from seeing that progress was being made .
Such lack of transparency applied to other areas too : for instance , he would appreciate more precise information concerning the efforts of the judicial authorities to draw up rules , instructions , methods and practices for conducting investigations , and whether any concrete proposals had been made towards abolishing the death penalty , which the Government was reported to be considering .
It was his understanding that the considerable number of girls under 18 years of age who were marrying out of economic necessity did so not under domestic law but under Sharia law .
He wondered what steps the Government was taking to address the discrepancy between the two types of law .
Lastly , he wished to know how the State party planned to address the reports concerning the negative consequences of the criminalization of homosexuality under Uzbek law , including potential extortion by State authorities and private individuals .

Sixtieth session
Proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006 - 2007 *
Part X
Jointly financed administrative activities and special expenses
Section 30
Jointly financed administrative activities
( Programme 26 of the biennial programme plan and priorities for the period 2006 - 2007 ) **
Contents
Overview
30.1 Provisions under the present section cover the requirements for the United Nations share in the costs of three administrative organizational units of the United Nations common system financed on an inter - agency basis .
They are :
( a ) The International Civil Service Commission ( ICSC ) and its secretariat ;
( b ) The Joint Inspection Unit and its secretariat ;
( c ) The secretariat of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination ( CEB ) .
30.2 The full budgets of the International Civil Service Commission and the Joint Inspection Unit are also presented to the General Assembly for its consideration and approval in accordance with the established arrangements .
The comments of the Chief Executives Board on the budget proposals of the Joint Inspection Unit for the biennium 2006 - 2007 , which are required by its statute , will be submitted separately .
The full budget of CEB is also presented for information purposes , while the United Nations share of it is presented for approval .
30.3 Unlike in the biennium 2004 - 2005 , this section does not include the activities and the related resources for inter-organizational security measures .
In line with General Assembly resolution 59/267 ( XI ) of 23 December 2004 , those activities have been subsumed by the Department of Safety and Security and are now reflected under section 33 , Safety and security .
30.4 The overall framework of the expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement for the biennium 2006 - 2007 is presented by organizational unit in table 30.1 .
Table 30.1 Framework of expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement by component
30.5 The proposals for the regular budget appropriation made under this section reflect a net increase of $ 247,500 , or 2.4 per cent , over the level approved for the biennium 2004 - 2005 .
The requirements were estimated on the basis of the full budgets of the activities , and the percentage share of the United Nations in those costs , determined by CEB on the basis of established methodology .
The increase in the United Nations regular budget under this section is due to the delayed impact of new posts established in the biennium 2004 - 2005 under the full budget of the Board and the delayed application of revised percentages in calculating the United Nations share of costs .
The percentage distribution of regular budget resources under this section is as shown in table 30.2 .

30.6 The estimated requirements under the full budgets of the activities programmed in this section are summarized in table 30.4 .
The post establishment in the context of the full budgets is summarized in table 30.5 .
Due to the inter-agency nature of these operations , all the posts budgeted in this section are outside the United Nations regular budget staffing table .

30.7 By its resolution 3357 ( XXIX ) of 18 December 1974 , the General Assembly established the International Civil Service Commission for the regulation and coordination of the conditions of service of the United Nations common system .
Under its statute , the Commission is a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly .
It performs its functions in respect of the United Nations and of those specialized agencies and other international organizations that participate in the United Nations common system .
In the exercise of its functions , the Commission is guided by the principle set out in the agreements between the United Nations and the other organizations , aiming at the development of a single unified international civil service through the application of common personnel standards , methods and arrangements .
The Commission is further mandated through General Assembly resolutions 51/216 of 18 December 1996 and 52/216 of 22 December 1997 to play a lead role in the development of innovative approaches in the field of human resources management as part of the overall reform currently taking place in the organizations of the common system .
30.8 Under article 21 , paragraph 2 , of the statute of ICSC , a provision is made for the inclusion of the ICSC budget in the regular budget of the United Nations .
The budget estimates for the Commission are submitted by the Secretary - General after consultation with CEB on the basis of proposals made by the Commission .
30.9 In accordance with General Assembly resolution 57/285 of 20 December 2002 , the Commission was reviewed by the Panel on the Strengthening of the International Civil Service ( A/59/153 ) .
The report of the Panel , its recommendations and the comments of CEB thereon remain under consideration by the General Assembly .
30.10 The overall broad objectives of the Commission 's programme of work are : ( a ) to develop further and to strengthen a common system of salaries , allowances and benefits under the Noblemaire and Flemming principles ; ( b ) to equalize the purchasing power of salaries worldwide through post adjustment classifications ; ( c ) to develop and maintain equitable job evaluation and other human resources management systems ; ( d ) to provide guidance and advice on their administration ; and ( e ) to provide substantive support to Member States and common system organizations ( including staff ) in the reform and maintenance of a coherent and effective human resources management system more closely aligned with the achievement of organizational goals and objectives .
30.11 The Chairman of the Commission is responsible for directing its work . The Executive Secretary , as the Chief Administrative Officer of the Commission , is responsible for the preparation of the budget estimates , in consultation with the Chairman and Vice - Chairman , and for submitting them to the Secretary - General .
Programme of work of the International Civil Service Commission
30.12 It is expected that ICSC will hold two sessions with a total duration of six weeks in 2006 and two sessions with a total duration of four to five weeks in 2007 .
Of the two sessions held each year , one will take place in New York and the other will be held elsewhere , in principle , at the headquarters of one of the participating organizations of the United Nations common system .
The Commission may also decide to establish working groups on selected issues .
Those working groups would be composed of members of the Commission and / or its secretariat , as well as representatives of the member organizations and staff .
It is expected that during the biennium 2006 - 2007 , four such working groups will be established and that each of the groups will meet for approximately two weeks .
Furthermore , it is anticipated that representatives of the Commission will participate in the meetings ( 1 meeting per year ) of the technical working groups established by the governing bodies of the participating organizations .
30.13 The Commission 's Advisory Committee on Post Adjustment Questions will hold one session of one - week duration in each year of the biennium .

Table 30.7 Resource requirements : total requirements for the International Civil Service Commission ( full budget )
30.20 The estimated requirements in the amount of $ 15,017,800 would provide for the continuation of 46 posts ( 1 D - 2 , 3 D - 1 , 3 P - 5 , 8 P - 4 , 4 P - 3 , 3 P - 2 , and 24 General Service ( 2 Principal level ) ) and related non-post operational requirements , including consultancy , travel , contractual services , general operating expenses , supplies and equipment .
There is no change in the overall level of resource requirements under the full budget of the Commission .
However , an additional provision of $ 893,000 would be required under consultancy services to undertake the five - year cycle studies on new approaches in performance and broadbanding due in this biennium in accordance with resolution 52/216.
These additional requirements would be offset by a reduction in the same amount under general operating expenses .
Table 30.8 Resource requirements : United Nations share in the budget of the International Civil Service Commission
30.21 The estimated requirements in the amount of $ 5,661,700 , reflecting an increase of $ 24,100 , relate to the United Nations share ( currently 37.7 per cent ) in the budget of ICSC for the biennium 2006 - 2007 .
The increase of $ 24,100 is the result of a delay in the application of the revised cost -sharing percentage to the full amount of the gross budget after recosting in the 2004 - 2005 biennium .
Joint Inspection Unit
Full budget of the Joint Inspection Unit ( before recosting ) : $ 10,574,900

The report will be submitted separately .
30.24 According to the statute , the Inspectors have the broadest powers of investigation in all matters bearing on the efficiency of services and the proper use of funds and provide an independent view through inspection and evaluation aimed at improving management and methods and at achieving greater coordination among organizations .
The Unit submits an annual report on its activities to the General Assembly and to the competent legislative organs of its other participating organizations .
30.25 In line with the directives of the legislative organs of its participating organizations , the Unit takes full advantage of its system - wide competence in undertaking comparative analysis of trends and problems faced by various organizations and proposing harmonized , practical and concrete solutions .

It will elaborate broad guidance to CEB for meeting the challenges stemming from the ongoing reform of the United Nations system in an integrated and coherent manner , bringing the full capacities and potential of the United Nations system to bear in areas of strategic importance related to peace and development .
In particular , it will focus on developing integrated and systemic responses to both hard and soft threats to peace and security , including transnational organized crime ; poverty , disease and environmental degradation ; and the impact of migration and the protection of vulnerable populations displaced due to conflict and natural disasters .
It will continue to monitor system - wide support for the development of Africa , particularly within the framework of the New Partnership for Africa 's Development , and strengthen collaboration with civil society organizations .
30.36 During the biennium 2006 - 2007 , the High - Level Committee on Management will continue to place emphasis on human resources management and the reform of the common system by pursuing a range of specific studies .
It will also continue to focus on promoting the implementation of inter-agency agreements on the security and safety of United Nations system personnel , United Nations system staff and their dependants living with HIV / AIDS and on contingency planning and emergency preparedness and greater commonality in health insurance arrangements .
In the financial and budgetary areas , emphasis will continue to be placed , inter alia , on results - based budgeting , accounting standards , cash management and relationships between regular and voluntary funding , as well as on the development of best practices .
In the area of information and communication technology , the Committee will continue to focus on capitalizing on investments in that field .
The Committee will continue to promote the development of initiatives to facilitate access to United Nations system information by Member States and the general public .
Tools for knowledge - sharing and management will be further developed , and joint purchasing will be expanded through framework agreements and volume discounts .
30.37 In support of the tasks of CEB and its two high - level committees , the secretariat provides support , services and information to Member States and CEB member organizations on programme and operational policy issues of system - wide importance , as well as on activities and developments of inter-agency concern in the areas of human resources , information and communication technology , finance , budget and support services .
It facilitates the consultative processes between the Secretary - General and members of CEB , particularly when new policy initiatives are contemplated or when comprehensive and complementary responses to major international developments are required .
The secretariat follows up on CEB decisions , develops system - wide positions in policy , programme and operational areas and promotes knowledge - sharing within the system .
It supports research to promote best practices and serves as a clearing house for ideas and information on developments of interest to the system with a view to avoiding duplication and ensuring synergy .
It maintains , on behalf of the system , a number of agreements and other arrangements related to the conditions of service of staff of the common system and supports the governance mechanisms of the United Nations System Staff College , pursuant to General Assembly resolution 55/278 of 12 July 2001 .
Exchange of information throughout the system is enhanced through the maintenance of a series of databases and websites .

Recalling Article 5 , paragraph 1 , of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , in particular its provision that each Party included in Annex I shall have in place , no later than one year prior to the start of the first commitment period , a national system for the estimation of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol ,
Recognizing the importance of such national systems for the implementation of other provisions of the Kyoto Protocol ,
Having considered decision 20 / CP. 7 , adopted by the Conference of the Parties at its seventh session ,
Adopts the guidelines for national systems under Article 5 , paragraph 1 , of the Kyoto Protocol as contained in the annex to the present decision ; Urges Parties included in Annex I to implement the guidelines as soon as possible .
Guidelines for national systems for the estimation of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks under Article 5 , paragraph 1 , of the Kyoto Protocol
Applicability The provisions of these guidelines shall apply for each Party included in Annex I which is also a Party to the Kyoto Protocol .
Parties ' implementation of national system requirements may differ according to national circumstances , but shall include the elements described in these guidelines .
Any differences in implementation shall not impair the performance of the functions described in these guidelines .
Definitions Definition of national system A national system includes all institutional , legal and procedural arrangements made within a Party included in Annex I for estimating anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol , and for reporting and archiving inventory information .
Other definitions The meaning of the following terms in these guidelines for national systems is the same as in the glossary of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) good practice guidance , accepted by the IPCC at its sixteenth session :
Good practice is a set of procedures intended to ensure that greenhouse gas inventories are accurate in the sense that they are systematically neither over - nor underestimated as far as can be judged , and that uncertainties are reduced as far as possible .
Good practice covers choice of estimation methods appropriate to national circumstances , quality assurance and quality control at the national level , quantification of uncertainties , and data archiving and reporting to promote transparency Quality control ( QC ) is a system of routine technical activities to measure and control the quality of the inventory as it is being developed .
The QC system is designed to : Provide routine and consistent checks to ensure data integrity , correctness and completeness ; Identify and address errors and omissions ; Document and archive inventory material and record all QC act0ivities .
Quality control activities include general methods such as accuracy checks on data acquisition and calculations and the use of approved standardized procedures for emission calculations , measurements , estimating uncertainties , archiving information and reporting .
Higher tier QC activities also include technical reviews of source categories , activity and emission factor data and methods
Quality assurance ( QA ) activities include a planned system of review procedures conducted by personnel not directly involved in the inventory compilation development process , to verify that data quality objectives were met , ensure that the inventory represents the best possible estimate of emissions and sinks given the current state of scientific knowledge and data available , and support the effectiveness of the QC programme Key source category is one that is prioritized within the national inventory because its estimate has a significant influence on a country 's total inventory of direct greenhouse gases in terms of the absolute level of emissions , the trend in emissions , or both Decision tree is a flow - chart describing the specific ordered steps which need to be followed to develop an inventory or an inventory component in accordance with the principles of good practice .
Recalculation , consistent with the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories , is a procedure for re-estimating anthropogenic greenhouse gas ( GHG ) 6 emissions by sources and removals by sinks of previously submitted inventories7 as a consequence of changes in methodologies , changes in the manner in which emission factors and activity data are obtained and used , or the inclusion of new source and sink categories .

Problems should be identified as a failure to follow agreed guidelines under Article 5 , paragraph 2 , in preparing greenhouse gas inventories , as a failure to follow section I of the guidelines for the preparation of the information required under Article 7 , and as a failure to follow agreed methodologies for estimating and reporting activities under Article 3 , paragraphs 3 and 4 , as adopted by the COP / MOP .
These may be further subdivided as problems of :
Transparency , as defined in the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories , including : Inadequate documentation and description of methodologies , assumptions and recalculations ; Failure to disaggregate national activity data , emission factors and other factors used in national methods at the required level unless an issue of confidentiality exists ; Failure to provide justifications for recalculations , references and information sources for key factors and data ; Consistency , as defined in the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories , including failure to provide consistent time - series in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance ; Comparability , as defined in the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories , including failure to use agreed reporting formats ; Completeness , as defined in the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories , including : Gaps in the inventory estimates for source categories or gases ; Inventory data that do not provide full geographic coverage of sources and sinks of a Party included in Annex I ; Failure to provide full coverage of sources in a source category ; Accuracy , as defined in the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories , including failure to provide estimates of uncertainty and address uncertainty through the application of the good practice guidance .
The expert review team shall calculate :
The percentage by which the aggregate adjusted greenhouse gas emissions for a Party included in Annex I exceed the aggregate submitted emissions , defined as aggregate submitted emissions of the gases and from the sources listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol , for any single year ; The sum of the numerical values of the percentages calculated in subparagraph ( a ) above for all years of the commitment period for which the review has been conducted .
The expert review team shall identify whether the same key source category as defined in chapter 7 of the IPCC good practice guidance was adjusted in previous reviews and , if so , the team shall indicate the number of reviews that identified and adjusted the problem previously and the percentage that the key source category contributes to the aggregate submitted emissions , defined as aggregate submitted emissions of the gases and from the sources listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol .
Timing
The individual inventory review , including adjustment procedures , shall be concluded within one year of the due date of submission of the information to be reported under Article 7 , paragraph 1.
The expert review team shall list all problems identified , indicating which would need an adjustment , and send this list to the Party included in Annex I no later than 25 from the submission due date of the annual inventory , if the inventory was submitted at least six weeks after the submission due date .
The Party included in Annex I shall comment on these questions within six weeks and , where requested by the review team , may provide revised estimates .
The expert review team shall prepare a draft individual inventory review report , which includes , where appropriate , adjusted estimates calculated according to guidance under Article 5 , paragraph 2 , within eight weeks of the receipt of the comments on the questions posed and shall send the draft report to the Party concerned .
The Party included in Annex I shall be provided with four weeks to comment on the draft individual inventory review report and , where appropriate , on whether it accepts or rejects the adjustment .
The expert review team shall prepare a final individual inventory review report within four weeks of the receipt of the comments on the draft report .
If a Party included in Annex I , during the above steps , is able to comment earlier than in the time frames given above , the Party concerned may use the time saved to comment on the revised final report .
A total of four additional weeks to comment may be granted to Parties included in Annex I whose national language is not one of the United Nations official languages .
Procedures for adjustments under Article 5 , paragraph 2
Adjustments referred to in Article 5 , paragraph 2 , of the Kyoto Protocol shall be applied only when inventory data submitted by Parties included in Annex I are found to be incomplete and / or are prepared in a way that is not consistent with the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance and any good practice guidance adopted by the COP / MOP .
The procedure for the calculation of adjustments shall be as follows :
During the individual inventory review , the expert review team shall identify problems to which the criteria in the guidance for adjustments under Article 5 , paragraph 2 , apply .
The expert review team shall officially notify the Party included in Annex I of the reason why an adjustment is considered necessary and provide advice on how the problem could be corrected ; The adjustment procedure should only commence after the Party included in Annex I has had opportunities to correct a problem and if the expert review team finds that the Party included in Annex I has not adequately corrected the problem through the provision of an acceptable revised estimate , in accordance with the time frames set out in paragraphs ‎ 73 to ‎ 78 above ; The expert review team shall calculate adjustments in accordance with any guidance under Article 5 , paragraph 2 , adopted by the COP / MOP , in consultation with the Party concerned and within the time frame set out in these guidelines ; The expert review team shall officially notify the Party concerned of the calculated adjustment ( s ) within the time frame set out in these guidelines .
This notification shall describe the assumptions , data and methodologies used to calculate the adjustment ( s ) , as well as the value of the adjustment ( s ) ; Within the time frame set out in these guidelines , the Party concerned shall notify the secretariat of its intention to accept or reject the adjustment ( s ) , with its rationale .
Failure to respond by this date shall be considered as acceptance of the adjustment ( s ) , as follows :
If the Party concerned accepts the adjustment ( s ) , the adjustment ( s ) shall be applied for the purpose of compilation and accounting of emissions inventories and assigned amounts ; If the Party concerned disagrees with the proposed adjustment ( s ) , it should send a notification to the expert review team , including its rationale , and the expert review team should send the notification along with its recommendation in its final report to the COP / MOP and the Compliance Committee , which will resolve the disagreement in accordance with the procedures and mechanisms on compliance .
A Party included in Annex I may submit a revised estimate for a part of its inventory for a year of the commitment period to which an adjustment was previously applied , provided that the revised estimate is submitted , at the latest , in conjunction with the inventory for the year 2012 .
Subject to a review under Article 8 and the acceptance of the revised estimate by the expert review team , the revised estimate shall replace the adjusted estimate .
In the event of a disagreement between the Party included in Annex I and the expert review team regarding the revised estimate , the procedure set out in paragraph 80 ( e ) ( ii ) above shall be followed .
The option for a Party included in Annex I to submit a revised estimate for a part of its inventory to which an adjustment was previously applied should not prevent Parties included in Annex I from making best efforts to correct the problem at the time it was initially identified and in accordance with the time frame set forth in the guidelines for review under Article 8.

A Party included in Annex I that intends to submit information under paragraph 149 to the secretariat on the matter or matters which led to its suspension of eligibility should provide the secretariat with at least six weeks notice of the date on which it intends to submit such information .
The secretariat , on receipt of such notice , should undertake the necessary preparations with the aim of ensuring that an expert review team is convened and ready to start consideration of the information within two weeks of the receipt of the submission of information under paragraph 149 above from the Party concerned .
For the expedited procedure for the review for reinstatement of eligibility , the following time frames shall apply from the date of receipt of the information : The expert review team shall prepare a draft expedited review report within five weeks of the receipt of information from the Party concerned The Party concerned shall be provided with up to three weeks to comment upon the draft expedited review report .
If the Party concerned notifies the expert review team , within that period of time , that it does not intend to provide comments , then the draft expedited review report becomes the final expedited review report upon receipt of such notification .
If the Party concerned does not provide any comments within that period of time , the draft expedited review report becomes the final expedited review report If comments by the Party are received within the time frame indicated above , the expert review team shall prepare a final expedited review report within three weeks of the receipt of comments upon the draft report .
The time periods in paragraph 156 ( a ) to ( c ) above are considered maximum time periods .
The expert review team and the Party should strive to complete the review in the shortest time possible .
However , the expert review team may , with the agreement of the Party , extend the time periods in paragraph 156 ( a ) to ( c ) above for the expedited review procedure for an additional four weeks .
Where the start of the consideration of information by the expert review team is delayed due to the Party giving shorter notice than provided in paragraph 155 , the expert review team may extend the time in paragraph 156 ( a ) up to the difference in time between the period for notification in paragraph 155 and the actual notification given by the Party .
Reporting
The expert review team shall , under its collective responsibility , produce a final review report on the reinstatement of eligibility in accordance with the relevant provisions of paragraph 48 of these guidelines and in accordance with the relevant provisions for review reports in parts II , III , IV or V of these guidelines depending on the specific reason for the suspension of eligibility .
The expert review team shall include a statement whether the team considered thoroughly all questions of implementation that led to the suspension of the eligibility in the time available for the reinstatement procedure and shall indicate whether there is or is not any longer a question of implementation with respect to the eligibility of the Party concerned to use the mechanisms established under Articles 6 , 12 and 17 .

“ Article ” in these guidelines refers to an Article of the Kyoto Protocol , unless otherwise specified .
The guidelines for national systems for the estimation of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks under Article 5 , paragraph 1 , of the Kyoto Protocol are referred to herein as “ guidelines for national systems ” .
The IPCC Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories is referred to as the “ IPCC good practice guidance ” in these guidelines for national systems .
Montreal , 1 - 8 May 2000 .
The inventory reporting guidelines were revised by decisions 18 / CP.8 and 13 / CP.9 , after these national system guidelines were agreed by decision 20 / CP .7 .
The current inventory reporting guidelines are contained in document FCCC / SBSTA/2004/8.
Because the inventory reporting guidelines may be revised in the future , this footnote will be deleted in the final text , after adoption by the COP / MOP .
6 References to greenhouse gases ( GHG ) in these guidelines for national systems refer to GHG s not controlled by the Montreal Protocol .
7 “ National GHG inventories ” are referred to simply as “ inventories ” in these guidelines for the sake of brevity .
8 For the purpose of these guidelines for national systems , the inventory development process encompasses inventory planning , preparation and management .
These steps of the inventory development process are considered in these guidelines only in order to clearly identify the functions to be performed by the national systems , as described in paragraphs 12 to 17 of the present guidelines .

“ Article ” in these guidelines refers to an Article of the Kyoto Protocol , unless otherwise specified .
It is recognized in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories that the current practice on land use , land - use change and forestry does not in every situation request annual data collection for the purpose of preparing annual inventories based on a sound scientific basis .
The elected activities shall be the same as those identified in the Party 's report referred to in paragraph 8 of the annex to decision -/ CMP.1 ( Modalities for the accounting of assigned amounts ) .
Such information shall be within levels of confidence as elaborated by any IPCC good practice guidance adopted by the COP / MOP and in accordance with relevant decisions of the COP / MOP on land use , land - use change and forestry .
This recognizes that the intent of the appendix to the annex to decision -/ CMP .1 ( Land use , land - use change and forestry ) is to factor out the effects described in paragraphs 7 ( a ) - 7 ( c ) of these guidelines for the first commitment period .
See footnote 5 .
These terms are defined in paragraphs 1 - 4 of the annex to decision -/ CMP.1 ( Modalities for the accounting of assigned amounts ) and paragraph 1 of the annex to decision -/ CMP .1 ( Afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM ) .
In accordance with paragraph 40 of the annex to decision 19 / CP.9 ( Modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the clean development mechanism in the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ) , unless otherwise stated in that annex , all other provisions that pertain to certified emission reductions in the guidelines under Articles 7 and 8 , as well as the modalities for the accounting of assigned amounts under Article 7 , paragraph 4 , shall also apply to temporary certified emission reductions and long - term certified emission reductions .

“ Article ” in these guidelines refers to an article of the Kyoto Protocol , unless otherwise specified .
This will be the case if this national communication is submitted prior to the first commitment period .
It is likely that the fourth national communication will be the first national communication under the Kyoto Protocol and that such review will occur prior to the first commitment period : Article 7 , paragraph 3 , states that each Party included in Annex I shall submit the information required under Article 7 , paragraph 2 , as part of the first national communication due under the Convention after the Protocol has entered into force for it and after adoption of guidelines for the preparation of information under Article 7.
This Article also states that the COP / MOP shall determine the frequency of submission of national communications , taking into account any timetable for submission of national communications decided upon by the COP .
Decision 11/CP.4 requests Parties included in Annex I to submit a third national communication by 30 November 2001 and subsequent national communications on a regular basis , at intervals of three to five years , to be decided at a future session , and requires that each of those national communications should be subject to an in - depth review coordinated by the secretariat .
Those experts that opt not to participate in the training have to undergo a similar assessment successfully in order to enable them to qualify for participation in expert review teams .
In these guidelines , the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories are referred to as the IPCC Guidelines .
In these guidelines , the IPCC report entitled Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories is referred to as the IPCC good practice guidance .
For the initial review , the time frames for the initial check may serve as an indication .
“ Guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention , Part I : UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories ” ( FCCC / CP /1999 / 7 ) or any subsequent revision of these guidelines by the COP .
Special arrangements in the composition of the expert review teams may be needed for the case where an adjustment needs to be calculated .
In accordance with paragraph 40 of the annex to decision 19 / CP.9 ( Modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the clean development mechanism in the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ) , unless otherwise stated in that annex , all other provisions that pertain to certified emission reductions in the guidelines under Articles 7 and 8 , as well as the modalities for the accounting of assigned amounts under Article 7 , paragraph 4 , also apply to temporary certified emission reductions and long - term certified emission reductions .
The guidelines for national systems for the estimation of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks under Article 5 , paragraph 1 , of the Kyoto Protocol are referred to as “ guidelines for national systems ” in the present annex .

Draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.37/Rev.1 : Assistance to refugees , returnees and displaced persons in Africa
Ms. Ahmed ( Sudan ) , introducing draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.37/Rev.1 on behalf of the Member States of the United Nations that were members of the African Group , announced that Cyprus , Norway and the Czech Republic were sponsors .
She said that Africa hosted the largest number of refugees and internally displaced persons worldwide .
In some countries , substantial peace initiatives undertaken in 2003 had aroused hope for a solution , but in other countries prospects were bleak .
Often , the uprooted persons and the vulnerable communities that hosted them faced conditions that entailed untold suffering , a potential cause of new conflicts .
The draft resolution was therefore important .
It referred to the many initiatives undertaken to address the situation at various levels , particularly in Africa ; and called attention to significant recent developments , such as the decision adopted by the Executive Council of the African Union in July 2003 , the Declaration and Plan for Action adopted by the First Ministerial Conference on Human Rights in Africa in May 2003 and the four " Rs " approach ( repatriation , reintegration , rehabilitation and reconstruction ) of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) - an approach with which many States had associated themselves .
The speaker said that the text before the Committee was the outcome of numerous consultations .
She hoped that , as at previous sessions , the draft resolution would be adopted by consensus , given its humanitarian and non-political character .
The Chairman announced that Italy and Denmark had become sponsors of the draft resolution .
Draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.38 : Assistance to unaccompanied refugee minors
Ms. Ahmed ( Sudan ) introduced draft resolution A / C.3/58/L.38 on behalf of the sponsors listed and Azerbaijan , Cameroon , Madagascar , Pakistan , Panama , Qatar , United Republic of Tanzania , Turkey and Yemen .
She stated that the text sought to draw the international community 's attention to the precarious situation of unaccompanied refugee children , a particularly vulnerable group .
Many children were displaced and homeless for various reasons , without anybody addressing their needs .
The draft resolution focused on encouraging preventive measures and the identification of appropriate solutions , including family reunification .
The speaker drew attention to the following revisions : in the third preambular paragraph , the order of the expressions " malaria " and " human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome " should be reversed to read : " such as human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome , malaria … " ; in the sixth preambular paragraph , the word " Reaffirming " should be replaced with the word " Recalling " ; in the seventh operative paragraph , the words " human rights law and refugee law " should be inserted after the words " international humanitarian law " ; and , in the ninth operative paragraph , the words " the most effective initial means " should be replaced with the words " among the most effective initial means " .
The speaker hoped that , as at previous sessions , the draft resolution would be adopted by consensus .
The Chairman announced that the following countries had become sponsors of the draft resolution : Botswana , Malawi , Mozambique , Namibia , Rwanda , Sierra Leone , Swaziland , Zambia and Zimbabwe .
Draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.43 : Follow - up to the Regional Conference to Address the Problems of Refugees , Displaced Persons , Other Forms of Involuntary Displacement and Returnees in the Countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and Relevant Neighbouring States
Mr. Knyazhinskiy ( Russian Federation ) , introducing draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.43 on behalf of the sponsors , said that it aimed to provide additional political impetus in the General Assembly to implement follow - up actions to the 1996 regional conference .
Compared to the draft resolution introduced during the fifty - sixth session of the General Assembly , it contained some new elements : the subregional initiatives undertaken within the framework of transboundary cooperation , the convening in Sweden in September 2002 of the senior - level review meeting and the call to lend high - level political support to ensure the implementation of activities undertaken in follow - up to the Programme of Action .
The speaker hoped that the draft resolution would be adopted by consensus .
The Chairman announced that the following countries had become sponsors of the draft resolution : Cyprus , Croatia , Denmark , Spain , United States of America , France , Ireland , Italy , Kyrgyzstan , Norway , Portugal , Czech Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and North Ireland .
Agenda item 117 : Human rights questions

Draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.42 : Torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
Ms. Thygesen ( Denmark ) introduced draft resolution A / C.3/58/L.42 on behalf of the sponsors listed and South Africa , Andorra , Armenia , Australia , Azerbaijan , Bangladesh , Burkina Faso , Cape Verde , Eritrea , Lithuania , Mali , Malta , Monaco and Ukraine .
The speaker drew attention to the following revisions : in the third line of operative paragraph 2 , the word " and " should be inserted before the word " stresses " ; and in operative paragraph 17 , the words " for his interim report " should be deleted and the words " Congratulates the " should be replaced with the words " Notes with appreciation the interim report of the " .
The draft resolution , an outcome of extensive consultations , could play a significant role in combating torture and the speaker hoped that it would be adopted by consensus .
The Chairman announced that the following countries had become sponsors of the draft resolution : Ecuador , Estonia , Mauritius , Micronesia ( Federated States of ) , Namibia and Turkey .
Draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.44:International covenants on human rights
Mr. Berg ( Sweden ) introduced draft resolution A / C.3/58/L.42 on behalf of the sponsors listed and South Africa , Australia , Azerbaijan , Cyprus , Ecuador , Greece , Lithuania , Nicaragua , Panama , Peru , Dominican Republic , Serbia and Montenegro and Ukraine .
The speaker said that the draft resolution pleaded for equal representation of women and men on the Human Rights Committee and the Economic , Social and Cultural Rights Committee and was being introduced after successive negotiations .
A number of revisions had been made to the initial text to ensure that it reflected the broad range of views expressed by the various delegations . She hoped that , in accordance with past practice , the draft resolution would be adopted by consensus .
The Chairman announced that Estonia , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Lesotho had become sponsors of the draft resolution .
Draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.30/Rev.1 : International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families
Mr. Simancas ( Mexico ) introduced draft resolution A / C.3/58/L.45 on behalf of the sponsors listed and Egypt , Ecuador , Honduras , Paraguay and Senegal .
He said that in the English version of the text the words " in due time " should be replaced with the words " in a timely manner " .
After stressing the importance of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the need to ensure its universal application , he quoted operative paragraphs 1 and 5 .
The sponsors had taken account of the concerns expressed by the various delegations and therefore hoped that the draft resolution would be adopted without a vote .
The Chairman announced that the following countries had become sponsors of the draft resolution : Bangladesh , Burkina Faso , Mali , Uganda , Democratic Republic of the Congo , Dominican Republic and Tunisia .
( b ) Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms
Draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.30/Rev.1 : Situation of and assistance to Israeli children
Mr. Gillerman ( Israel ) , introducing draft resolution A / C.3/58/L.30/Rev.1 , said that Israel would have preferred a comprehensive treatment of children , in accordance with standing practice , but had decided to introduce the text when , for the second consecutive year , the sponsors of draft resolution A / C.3/58/L.24 , addressing only the situation of Palestinian children , had insisted on putting it to a vote against the wish of many delegations .
Israel had been prepared to withdraw its text , but since draft resolution A / C.3/58/L.24 had been adopted , it was necessary and fair to sponsor a resolution addressing the suffering of Israeli children as a result of Palestinian terrorism .
The text of the draft resolution having been distributed to the delegations , the representative of Israel proceeded with a brief presentation , stressing the amendments made to the initial version , particularly in order to take account of the outcome of consultations held with the delegations concerned .
After quoting preambular paragraphs 4 and 5 , he recalled that , since September 2000 , terrorist groups such as Hamas , Islamic Jihad and the Al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigade had killed 903 Israelis , including 109 children , and injured thousands .
Many terrorist attacks had deliberately targeted children .
Addressing only the situation of Palestinian children and disregarding the difficulties faced by Israeli children would suggest that one side to the conflict held a monopoly over victim status .
Certain that most delegations realized the suffering inflicted on Israeli children by terrorism , the representative of Israel urged the delegations to support the draft resolution .
Ms. Al Haj Ali ( Syrian Arab Republic ) said that the Syrian delegation was opposed to draft resolution A / C.3/58/L.30/Rev.1 , which had been introduced under the wrong agenda item .
Its content did not fall within the competence of the Third Committee . The speaker requested the General Committee to introduce it under another agenda item .
Ms. Rasheed ( Observer for Palestine ) stated Palestine 's observations on the initial version of the draft resolution ( A /C.3/58/L.30 ) .
By copying the form and text of the draft resolution on the situation of and assistance to Palestinian children ( A / C.3/58/L.24 ) , which had already been adopted , Israel showed how insensitive it was to the Palestinian children 's suffering , which it tried to trivialize .
Having steadily maintained that there should be no resolution on the situation of any particular group of children and used that argument to reject the draft resolution on the plight of Palestinian children , Israel was contradicting itself .
Palestine maintained that the situation of Palestinian children was unique . That meant neither that their situation was worse than the situation of other children nor that the Palestinian children held a monopoly over suffering .
The form and content of the draft resolution reflected the distorted and unacceptable character of the Israeli positions and all references to the situation of children were subordinated to those political considerations .
The revised version before the Committee aimed at avoiding the rejection of the draft resolution - which largely fell outside the competence of the Third Committee - by a vast majority of the delegations .
The text remained inadmissible even after the revisions .
Palestine hoped that , if put to a vote , it would be rejected .
Mr. Kronfol ( Lebanon ) said that his delegation associated itself with the statements of the representative of the Syrian Arab Republic and of the Observer for Palestine .
Mr. Mavrommatis ( Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Iraq ) introduced his interim report on the situation of human rights in Iraq ( A /58/338 ) .
He quoted paragraphs 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 and 8 and referred in particular to the bomb attack of 19 August 2003 against the headquarters of the United Nations mission in Baghdad , in which the Special Representative of the Secretary - General for Iraq and United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , to whom he paid tribute , as well as 22 other devoted United Nations officials , had lost their lives . That event had compelled him to postpone his mission to Iraq , initially scheduled for 22 - 27 September 2003 .
If he had been able to visit Iraq , he would have reported on the outcome of his mission , and made his observations , in an addendum .
Given the particular situation of Iraq in the preceding eight months , very little reliable information had been available to the local and international non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , the United Nations or other sources in that country .
That shortage in reliable information compounded the difficulty of his mission , which comprised the examination of sensitive issues , such as mass graves , the situation of displaced persons and refugees , prison conditions , the impunity enjoyed by perpetrators of serious and systematic human rights violations , and freedom of religion .
Under those circumstances , the speaker had decided to hold a series of preparatory talks in Geneva . They had taken place on 13 - 16 October 2003 and allowed him to resume regular contact with the Chargé d'affaires of the Permanent Mission of Iraq , to whom he confirmed in writing his intention to organize meetings and consultations with the appropriate ministers of the Iraqi Governing Council and the representatives of the Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) and civil society .
He had also stated his wish to examine , in the eventual talks , the issues of violations of the right to life ( particularly disappearances , summary executions and mass graves ) , torture , prison conditions , freedom of religion , " Arabization " and gender equality , and to monitor compliance with the recommendations that he had made during his first visit to Iraq in 2002 .
The Geneva talks had also enabled him to hold separate meetings with the Permanent Representatives of Kuwait , the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America , a representative of the Kurdish Regional Government and members of international NGOs .
Strengthened cooperation between the Iraqi and Kuwaiti delegations had permitted to identify a - still limited - number of persons who had been missing .
Other delicate issues had been addressed and the Special Rapporteur had been invited to participate in the Madrid Donors ' Conference on 23 - 24 October 2003 .
In Madrid , lack of time had prevented the Special Rapporteur from encountering as many officials as planned , but he had met on his request the main CPA and Governing Council representatives and his mere presence there provided evidence of his determination to accomplish the tasks of his mandate .
During his discussion with the Iraqi Minister for Human Rights and brief exchanges of opinions with the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy , Human Rights and Labour , he had reiterated his intention to visit Iraq as soon as security conditions would allow .
He had also stressed that Iraq , and therefore the CPA and the interim Governing Council , were expected to respect the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
Those meetings and the meetings held in Geneva had aimed to ensure the collection of sufficient information in the very near future for inclusion in the next report of the Special Rapporteur .
The consultations to be held in December 2003 with representatives of the CPA , the interim Governing Council and Iraqi and international non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) and with private citizens were also expected to yield considerable reliable information .
Doubtlessly , nothing could replace going to Iraq , and the Special Rapporteur reiterated his intention to do everything he could in order to visit the country as soon as possible .
Mr. Dugard ( Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 ) said that the General Assembly had characterized the wall that Israel was building on Palestinian territory as a violation of international law and demanded from Israel to discontinue its construction .
In view of tangible security concerns , Israel was entitled to build a wall along the 1949 Armistice Demarcation Line ( Green Line ) , but not on Palestinian territory .
Construction of the wall on Palestinian territory could only be regarded as de facto annexation , and the annexation of occupied territories was proscribed by the United Nations Charter and the Fourth Geneva Convention .
The decision to extend the wall to the settlement at Ariel , about 22 km into the West Bank , meant that about 16 percent of the West Bank would end up between the wall and the Green Line .
At the same time , there were attempts to cut off East Jerusalem from the West Bank .
Furthermore , Israel had declared the area between the wall and the Green Line a " closed zone " , where Israelis could move freely but the Palestinians , who lived and worked there , needed authorization to do so .
Palestinians on the Israeli side of the wall would be cut off from their lands , homes , clinics and schools .
Checkpoints were run arbitrarily , clearly with the intent to press the Palestinians to resettle on their side of the wall , an event that would create a new generation of displaced persons .
The Special Rapporteur said that the settlements constituted a violation of Article 49 , paragraph 6 , of the Fourth Geneva Convention , which forbade an occupying power to transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupied .
Israel no longer claimed - as in the past - to freeze the settlements . On the contrary , the Government had increased resource allocation to the settlements , including those that had earlier been considered illegal .
The Special Rapporteur noted that the wall and the settlements would have an extensive and adverse impact on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory , rendering Palestinian self - determination meaningless , as the Palestinian people would soon have too little land of their own on which to build a State . The wall and the settlements also constituted the main cause of the unbearable situation of the Palestinians , who were humiliated daily at the checkpoints ; and served to justify destruction of property on a large scale and environmental degradation .
The Special Rapporteur pointed out that he had deliberately decided not to deal with the other serious human rights violations : loss of human lives , excessive force used indiscriminately against civilians and combatants , ever more assassinations of Palestinians , detention of more than 6,000 Palestinians and transfer of prisoners under administrative detention from the West Bank to Gaza .
Mr. Gillerman ( Israel ) regretted that the Special Rapporteur reiterated allegations contained in his earlier reports disregarding Israel 's rectifications and continued to use his mandate as a means of pursuing his political agenda .
Israel 's position on the security wall was well known . It had been explained to the Security Council and the General Assembly .
He nevertheless wished to raise some further points concerning the Special Rapporteur 's last report .
Although he acknowledged Israel 's " legitimate security concerns " , the Special Rapporteur regarded the measures taken by Israel as disproportionate , failing to consider the menace of Palestinian terrorism , with its multitude of victims and its refusal to distinguish between civilian population and combatants .
Whether a measure was proportionate could not be determined mechanically and from afar , merely by tabulating reported damages and alleged casualties .
To that end , specialized , legal and operational , knowledge was required and account should be taken of the specific context in which the operations took place , the security situation that Israelis faced and the illegal use of Palestinian civilians as a human shield .
The speaker believed that by disregarding these factors the Special Rapporteur had deliberately made a selective and incorrect use of law and facts .
He noted that the Special Rapporteur did not consider any defensive measure taken by Israel as legitimate or proportionate to the act that had motivated it , and that he held Israel responsible for all the ills befalling the Palestinian people , absolving the Palestinian leaders and the Arab States that funded and favoured terrorism in the region . The Special Rapporteur thereby contributed to the problem rather than to its solution .
Mr. Mekhad ( Syrian Arab Republic ) said that the report of the Special Rapporteur provided further evidence of Israel 's brutal practices in the occupied territories and proved that Israel - by continuing to build the wall of racism - spurned the wish of the international community .
He concurred with the Special Rapporteur that the purpose behind the wall was a de facto annexation of an ever - larger part of Palestinian territory . That showed Israel 's intention to thwart any idea of an independent Palestinian State .
He recalled the warnings issued by Syria and other States against the expansionist wall and the intentions of Israel , which - in the event of a resumption of negotiations - could be expected to claim that the wall was its boundary with any Palestinian entity .
Discussions then would no longer concern the establishment of a Palestinian State but land demarcation .
Settlements played the same role . Such practices constituted terrorism and the international community had a duty to combat them by all means .
Terrorism could not be eradicated unless Israel also fought against it .
Israel 's so - called self - defence was defence of occupation and aggression .
Mr. Vigny ( Switzerland ) congratulated the Special Rapporteur for his report and assured him of Switzerland 's support in his mandate .
The representative of Switzerland wondered whether the Special Rapporteur could enlarge on the idea of proportionality .
Moreover , since the Special Rapporteur had in his report requested the Israeli authorities to either authorize an independent international committee to investigate the complaints of torture or to conduct themselves an independent and detailed judicial investigation into those allegations , the speaker asked whether the Special Rapporteur had any suggestion as to the specific international bodies that might be asked to conduct such an investigation or whether he thought that an independent international ad hoc committee should be set up to that end .
Lastly , the speaker asked whether the Special Rapporteur planned to conduct a new mission before the sixtieth meeting of the Commission on Human Rights to be held in Geneva in March - April 2004 .
Mr. Dugard ( Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 ) said that proportionality was an intricate issue and that he intended to further examine its various aspects .
It was very difficult to assess the proportionality of a reaction to an act . Regarding the proposal for a judicial investigation into cases of torture , although he had suggested setting up an independent committee , he was inclined to first give Israel a chance to handle that matter itself .
Regarding the observations of the representative of Israel , the Special Rapporteur said that he was cognizant of Israel 's security concerns , but considered that the facts regarding the wall and the settlements , which were illegal and had an enormous impact on human rights , were clearly established in his report .
He regretted that the representative of Israel had not addressed those two problems in his statement .
The meeting was suspended at 4.40 p.m. and resumed at 5.10 p.m.
Mr. Tekin ( Turkey ) said that he hoped that the improvement of security conditions in Iraq would allow the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Iraq to visit the country and better appraise the situation .
He also hoped that the Special Rapporteur 's future reports would deal with attempts after the war to alter the demographic structure in some parts of the country and that they would address the difficulties faced by some ethnic , religious and other population groups , including the Turkmen population .
Mr. De Laurentis ( United States ) thanked the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Iraq and said that he looked forward to the Special Rapporteurs ' visit to Iraq at the earliest opportunity .
Turning to the report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 , he said that his delegation would discuss its content in greater detail at the session of the Commission on Human Rights , where the report could be more appropriately examined .
He stated that he was very disappointed by the report , which he considered grossly one - sided , especially with regard to the proportionality principle .
The report ignored the context in which the decisions criticized had been made and helped the cause of neither human rights nor peace in the Middle East .
Mr. Al - Enezi ( Kuwait ) said that he regretted that for security reasons the Special Rapporteur had not been able to visit Iraq and noted that the problem of the prisoners was one of the issues that he had been instructed to examine .
He also noted that , according to information obtained through cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross , 45 victims had been identified .
He considered the offences committed as war crimes and , stressing that the Secretary General and the Security Council had denounced mass graves that had been discovered , he emphasized that the report of the Special Rapporteur should take account of the relevant information provided by the Government of Kuwait .
The speaker noted that , even at times when the Special Rapporteur had not been able to visit Iraq , it had been possible to draw up reports based on information supplied by Governments ; and asked whether the absence of a final report had any incidence related to the fact that no draft resolution had been introduced regarding the issue .
Ms. Melchiorre ( Italy ) , speaking on behalf of the European Union , inquired about ways to gather documentary evidence to investigate human rights violations under Saddam Hussein .
She also asked what international standards should govern steps taken by the Iraqis to set up a mechanism to examine those violations ; whether the Special Rapporteur had been able to address that issue with the Iraqi Governing Council and other representatives of Iraqi society ; and , if so , whether a timetable had been discussed .
Ms. Al - Khafaji ( Iraq ) said that the Iraq Permanent Mission to the United Nations would assist the Special Rapporteur in any way it could to enable him to carry out his mandate and hoped that the security situation would improve so that he could visit the country to complete his report .
Ms. Rasheed ( Observer for Palestine ) thanked the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 for his untiring efforts to raise awareness of the plight of Palestinians .
In connection with the wall that was being built , she wondered how Palestinians should react to the Israeli decree compelling them to apply for authorization to move within their own territory .
Israel tried to intimidate those who dared to speak the truth , particularly United Nations representatives , including special rapporteurs , and other international personalities .
Its attacks not only targeted their official function and their role , but also were physical , and had to be condemned .
All that the Special Rapporteur was doing was to describe the actual situation : confiscated land , demolished homes , institutionalized humiliation of a people , repression , detention , inhuman treatment and a colonialist policy that could not be hushed up .
Ms. Khalil ( Egypt ) said that the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 had provided an interesting account of the wall being built and the settlements , which once again highlighted the illegitimacy of the measures taken by Israel .
The report should be submitted to the Committee and duly considered by the international community .
Mr. Mavrommatis ( Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Iraq ) assured the representative of Turkey that he was in no way inattentive to the situation of ethnic , religious and other minorities .
He had already met with Turkmens twice and would do all he could to encounter others .
Replying to the United States representative , he said that he hoped that the assurances given him in Madrid about his security , should he visit Iraq , would facilitate such a visit in the near future .
Addressing the representative of Kuwait , he said that missing persons and the prisoners were among his top priorities .
He did not know whether the offences involved constituted crimes against humanity but , on the basis of available information , there was clear evidence of human rights violations .
Replying to the representative of Italy , he said that the Iraqi regime had been systematically recording events occurring in the country but many documents had disappeared as a result of looting and destruction in the wake of the war .
However , the Governing Council , the ministries and the CPA were trying to collect as much information as possible .
It seemed that the Government had been responsible for the disappearance of thousands of people , particularly in the northern Governorates .
NGOs could play a major role in gathering information .
As for meeting out punishment for past offences , the Special Rapporteur believed that the Governing Council was drafting legislation to set up a tribunal and hoped that its provisions would be compatible with Iraq 's international obligations , particularly the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . Addressing the representative of Iraq , he said he was looking forward to being able to cooperate with the Iraqi Government .
Mr. Dugard ( Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 ) reassured the representatives of Israel and the United States that he had followed no political agenda and his sole concern was respect for human rights .
Replying to the United States representative 's criticism that in his report he had taken a one - sided view of proportionality , he said that one should look at the facts .
Although sending Palestinian suicide bombers to stage attacks in Israel was deplorable and reprehensible , Israel 's response ( detaining 6,000 Palestinians , resorting to summary executions , demolishing homes , imposing curfews , and setting up checkpoints ) had been such that poverty was affecting 60 per cent of the Palestinian population . Nor was it possible to keep silent about the wall , which would interfere with the life of half a million Palestinians and seemed to redraw the boundary between the two territories .
The speaker was disappointed that the United States representative had made no reference to that issue and asked him to weigh all factors and to consider seriously whether he had actually overstated the case against Israel in his report .
The Special Rapporteur was convinced that on balance the facts were against Israel .
Ms. Noman ( Yemen ) applauded the courage of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 . She hoped that the international community , with all due impartiality , would press Israel to cease its violent activities .
The meeting rose at 17.35 p.m.

The current report is part of a continuous series prepared by the UNCTAD secretariat reviewing competition cases with special focus on developing countries .
The report looks at some cases with specific lessons regarding the implementation of competition laws .
Paragraph 6 ( c ) of agreed conclusions of the 2004 IGE meeting on Competition Law and Policy on its sixth session requested the UNCTAD secretariat to prepare for consideration by the Fifth United Nations Conference to Review all Aspects of the Set of Multilaterally Agreed Principles and Rules for the Control of Restrictive Business Practices " an information note on recent important cases , with special reference to competition cases involving more than one country , and taking into account information to be received from member States no later than 31 January 2005 " .
Accordingly , the cases reviewed in this report have been selected from information provided by some member States in response to a request for information sent out by the UNCTAD secretariat and from other publicly available materials .
Taking into account the relatively few cases involving developing countries for which it was possible to obtain information , a range of cases were selected for review , including those ( a ) having effects upon the markets of more than one country , including a developing country ; ( b ) involving enterprises not domiciled in the country where the case was considered ; or ( c ) cases from developed and developing countries involving issues or sectors which are relevant internationally , particularly for developing countries .
The cases reviewed in the current report show that , in a context of globalization and liberalization , competition law and policy are becoming a key element in some developing countries ' economic policies .
More and more countries are enforcing competition laws more rigorously and also adopting tactics such as the introduction of leniency programmes and dawn raids .
The importance of information sharing between competition authorities is also an aspect which comes out of this report .
However , the relatively small pool of cases and countries from which these samples were drawn suggests that although many developing countries are adopting , or have recently adopted , competition laws , more efforts need to be made by these countries to effectively enforce the competition laws and to create or strengthen a competition culture in their markets .
Some of the cases reviewed demonstrate that anti-competitive practices such as collusion and abuse of dominance occur in a variety of sectors and that in many instances anti-competitive practices involve a mixture of vertical and horizontal anti-competitive practices .
Similarly , competition authorities are increasingly called upon to assess the potential anti-competitive effects of mergers and acquisitions , that have either a domestic or an international dimension .
The present report deals with implementation successes , conflicts of or coordination of various policies , and also challenges .
However , there is still much room for improvement of enforcement techniques and also coordination between newly established competition authorities in developing countries and economies in transition with the competition authorities of developed countries .
I . Anti-competitive practices
Argentina : Cartel in the medical oxygen supply market
Brief description
The Competition Commission issued a judgement in July 2005 in which four foreign companies active in Argentina as suppliers of medical oxygen to public and private hospitals were fined 70.3 million pesos ( US$ 24 million ) for operating a price cartel for medical oxygen .
The companies are the local affiliates of Air Liquide ( France ) , Praxair ( United States ) , AGA ( Germany ) and Indura ( Chile ) .
The investigation was initiated in 1997 and concluded that the offending companies agreed to distribute customers amongst themselves while also participating in collusive tendering ( bid rigging ) .
In the course of its investigation , the Commission conducted four dawn raids , which resulted in the discovery of key documents showing the exchange of information about customers , bids , prices and the mechanism to allocate customers by means of agreeing which company would win each bid .
As a result of the cartel , hospitals and consumers were charged high prices for the medical oxygen and the cartel members enjoyed illegally acquired high profits .
Commentary
In particular , the existence of cartels in the medical industry has especially harmful effects in developing countries , where these vital goods and services are scarce .
Collusion between private firms is a significant source of foreign anti-competitive behaviour increasingly resulting in price and market rigging of cartels across developing countries that stifle competition in the markets of both developed and developing countries .
Without strong enforcement of competition laws , these cartels will continue to cause great harm to consumers in the developing world and this , in turn , has a detrimental effect on development .
The successful detection , investigation and prosecution of this cartel is a clear indication of the progress made by competition agencies in developing countries in eradicating these harmful cartels .
South Africa : Minimum resale price maintenance in the motor vehicle industry
Brief description
The South African Competition Commission was alerted by a member of the public who discovered while in the process of negotiating the purchase of a new Toyota Corolla that a number of Toyota dealerships offered the same discounts on the new Toyota Corolla range .
In addition , he reported that salespersons had advised him that failure to implement these discount structures would expose them to a stipulated fine .
This complaint came at an opportune time , when the Commission was still considering the public outcry about high car prices , and an investigation was immediately launched .
Various dealerships were contacted during the investigation and in the process the Commission obtained a copy of the pricing and discount structure document of Toyota South Africa Motors ( Pty ) Ltd.
This document was circulated to all Toyota dealerships and was possible proof of resale price maintenance .
The Commission 's preliminary investigation into dealerships , major motor vehicle manufacturers and importers of new motor vehicles throughout the country suggested that the practice of minimum resale price maintenance was widespread within the car industry .
Minimum resale price maintenance occurs when a manufacturer imposes a minimum resale price on a dealer , there by limiting or even excluding a dealer 's ability to offer discounts .
Such a practice rightly prohibited outright by section 5 ( 2 ) of the Competition Act.
The Commission decided to summon five Toyota dealer principals to appear before the Commission for hearings and to submit copies of all documentation relating to the determination of resale prices .
The evidence found indicated that a contravention of the Act was taking place , which meant that the matter should be referred to the Tribunal for Toyota SA to be prosecuted .
However , before the case against Toyota could be referred to the Tribunal , the parties entered into negotiations with the Commission to settle the case without referring .
A consent agreement was therefore concluded with Toyota , under the terms of which Toyota agreed to discontinue the practice and pay an administrative penalty of R12 million .
The penalty against Toyota sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to pursue any violations of the Competition Act.
Commentary
This case illustrates the importance of public awareness campaigns in the detection of anti-competitive conduct in developing countries and the beneficial effects that action by competition authorities may have in favour of consumers .
Through these campaigns , competition authorities stimulate a culture of competition and make the public realize how harmful anti-competitive practices are .
In addition , they encourage the public to blow the whistle on any company that still continues to breach the competition laws .
This also exemplifies a situation where competition offenders can choose to cooperate with competition authorities to resolve cases without having to undergo rigorous court procedures .
The effectiveness of such alternatives largely depends on the provisions provided by the law and the willingness of the parties concerned to take up the alternatives available .
Zambia : Anti-competitive restrictions on exports of cement
Brief description
The cement market in Zambia is virtually 100 per cent controlled by the monopoly undertaking Chilanga Cement , which is part of the Lafarge Group .
At the regional level , Lafarge has controlling cement interests in countries such as Zimbabwe , South Africa , Mozambique , Malawi , the United Republic of Tanzania and Kenya .
Between 2002 and 2003 , Chilanga Cement engaged in activities that appeared to be preventing , restricting and distorting the production and marketing of cement from Zambia to the traditional export markets for Zambian cement , which it now controlled in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) , Burundi and Rwanda ( the Great Lakes Region ) .
Chilanga Cement appeared to be engaged in production and pricing strategies that made Zambian export cement less competitive compared with the cement from its plant in Mbeya , ( United Republic of Tanzania ) .
The Commission 's investigation pointed to the fact that Chilanga Cement wanted to divide the regional market ( market allocation and territorial restrictions ) , whereby Zambian exports would be targeted to the DRC , while the Burundi and Rwandese markets were to be supplied from its Tanzanian plant .
Such conduct was likely to make the Zambian plant less competitive by restricting its production capacity .
The export pricing also appeared to make the landed price of Zambian cement higher .
It was further alleged that Chilanga Cement had been suppressing the local supply of cement in order to raise prices .
Further investigations also revealed a likely cartel of distributors who were alleged to be hoarding the product and thus creating an artificial shortage in the marketplace , leading to higher prices .
This was also compounded by higher unofficial exports of cement to Malawi and the DRC ( including smuggling ) .
The Commission advocated increased imports of cement , notably from Zimbabwe ( owing to lower logistical costs compared with South Africa ) , in order to curb this likely abuse of market power by Chilanga Cement .
Furthermore , it was decided that further investigations to test the recommended retail price regime were necessary in order to ensure that realistic market prices prevailed in the market in Zambia .
The Commission also advocated that the Government revisit the tariff structure of cement in order to make the landed price of imported cement from Zimbabwe more competitive than it was at the time .
Commentary
This case shows that in the absence of adequate evidence to prosecute anti-competitive practices , developing countries may sometimes use other government policies to tackle a competition case .
In the present case , government policies in Zambia in the area of exports , imports and tariffs were brought into play .
This brings in the critical issue of government policy coordination granting the competition agency an alternative avenue for dealing with competition issues .
In this regard , it is important for competition authorities to establish networking systems with other government bodies as part of their advocacy programmes , and to ensure that these bodies duly understand the benefits of their actions .
Czech Republic : Collusion in the fuel distribution industry
Brief description
Within a thirty - four hour period in May 2001 , six fuel distributors considerably increased their sale prices of fuel by almost the same amount within the whole national network of petrol stations .
The six fuel distributors maintained the high fuel prices until November 2001 despite the continuing trend of substantial decreases in their fuel purchase prices .
The Office for the Protection of Competition ( the Office ) found that there was no objective justification for this rise in prices other than a mutual agreement as a result of the distributors ' contact with each other through the Czech Association of Petrol Industry and Trade .
The Office conducted a dawn raid on the parties ' premises , which led to the discovery of evidence in the form of e-mail correspondence and other electronic documents .
The collusive behaviour distorted competition in the fuel market to the detriment of the end customer who bought fuel from filling stations .
The Office prohibited the anti-competitive behaviour and imposed a fine of CZK 313 million ( approximately US $ 10.6 million ) .
This constituted the highest total fine imposed in a single proceeding in the history of the Office .
The parties took the matter to appeal and the Chairman of the Office confirmed the first instance decision in May 2004 .
Commentary
Collusion in the oil industry has been suspected in many developing countries , but lack of evidence to prosecute has been a common scenario .
This is a success story in the fight against cartels that can be used by developing countries and also shows that it is possible to successfully detect and prosecute cartels .
A dawn raid is one method , which was used in this case , of finding evidence .
Successful dawn raids require sufficient resources and also coordination with other government arms , such as the police forces .
However , to enhance coordination , the police and other players need to realize the harm that cartel activity does to an economy .
This can be done through advocacy programmes designed and implemented by competition authorities .
Jamaica : Refusal of access to port facilities
Brief description
In February 2002 , the Fair Trade Commission ( FTC ) received a complaint from a stevedoring company ( SSL Ltd ) against another stevedoring company ( KWL LTD ) , which owns berths in Port Kingston .
It was alleged that KWL had denied independent stevedoring companies access to the port facilities , which SSL deemed to be necessary for carrying out its business .
Given that KWL handled all the non-containerized cargo in the port of Kingston , the existence of high barriers to entry ( due to a lack of suitable port locations ) and the absence of countervailing buyer power , KWL was considered to be a dominant player in the market for the supply of access to cargo freight infrastructure .
The decision of KWL , as a dominant port operator , to bar independent stevedores from using its port facility was seen as an anti-competitive practice aimed at driving out its existing or potential competitors in ancillary markets such as the stevedoring and towage markets .
The FTC held the view that KWL was entitled to advance its own commercial interests , but such behaviour was not acceptable under section 20 of the Fair Competition Act if its actual purpose was to strengthen and abuse its dominant position .
According to KWL , its actions were aimed at improving the efficiency of port operations .
The FTC felt that this objective could be attained through less restrictive means .
The Supreme Court issued an interim injunction in which it ordered KWL not to take any steps calculated to prevent , hinder or deter the plaintiff from engaging in stevedoring business , shipping agency business and / or ancillary operations in or with respect to the relevant berths .
The interim injunction , which allowed for the maintenance of competition in the market for the provision of stevedoring services , is still in effect as the Supreme Court is yet to issue a final decision .
Commentary
Abuse of dominance by firms operating in small markets where there is insufficient room for many firms to operate is common in developing countries .
In the current case , the denial of access to port facilities by the dominant player has negative anti-competitive effects in Jamaica .
Such a case can easily be resolved through administrative procedures if the concerned parties so choose .
Otherwise , court procedures may take a long time to resolve a case , and in this example it has taken quite a lengthy period .
Various jurisdictions have opted for specialized courts and tribunals to handle competition cases to avoid such delays .
However , the good thing about this case is that the interim order by the Supreme Court has sought to maintain competition in the market until the case has been determined .
Hungary : Cartel in the fertilizer industry
Brief description
In June 2005 the Competition Council of the Hungarian Competition Authority ( GVH - Gazdasági Versenyhivatal ) found evidence that Finland 's Kemira Graw Haow , Europe 's second largest fertilizer producer , and Belgium 's Tessanderlo had been colluding in the Hungarian fertilizer market .
The infringement , carried out as part of an international cartel , was the longest - operating cartel in Hungary , lasting from 1991 until 2003 .
The cartel agreement concerned market sharing and price fixing in the production and distribution of fodder phosphate , which is mainly used by producers of fodder for animals and by large meat producers , both of which produce fodder .
Members of the cartel exchanged information about , inter alia , the amounts of fertilizer sold , selling prices and evaluations of market demand .
They also shared quotas and , when the agreed quotas had been exceeded , a compensation mechanism was established .
The GVH has applied its leniency policy to the matter .
Under that policy , the GVH may waive fully or partially the fine to be imposed on those undertakings that cooperate in the detection of secret cartels and in the destabilization of functioning collusions .
Therefore , Kemira , which reported itself to the authority , will be exempt from paying any fines , which would have been above 1 billion HUF .
Tessanderlo , on the other hand will have to pay a fine of approximately 131 million HUF .
The fine has to be paid within 30 days from the date of delivery of the decision of the Competition Council .
Commentary
This case is a good example of the use of a leniency programme when dealing with cartel cases .
In the last decade , the introduction and application of such programmes have increased the detection of prosecution levels of cartel activity in both developed and developing countries .
Countries with provisions dealing with any form of cartelization should consider introducing leniency programmes as part of their regulations , while those in the process of drafting competition laws may consider developing a programme with initial implementation regulations .
Costa Rica : Resale price maintenance , and exclusive contracts in the market for carbonated non-alcoholic beverages and bottled fruit juice .
Brief description
After a number of complaints from the market , the Costa Rican Commission for the Promotion of Competition initiated an investigation into the alleged anti-competitive behaviour of the Coca Cola Company , the Coca Cola Interamerican Corporation and Panamco Tica S.A ( Panamco Tica ) . Panamco Tica purchases the syrup from Coca Cola and uses it to manufacture the final product .
It is primarily a company that manufactures , bottles and resells the finished product to wholesalers and retailers in Costa Rica .
The main practices investigated were resale price maintenance , tied sales and exclusive contracts .
The Commission reached its final decision on the matter in May 2004 .
During the investigation , it was discovered that Panamco Tica had included restrictive clauses in its contracts with retailers , binding them to resell the products at prices specified by Panamco Tica in regularly distributed price lists .
This was evidence of resale price maintenance , which affects intrabrand competition and limits the right of the retailer to apply his own sale prices .
The Commission sanctioned Panamco Tica by imposing a fine of ¢ 34,028,360 and compelled it to amend the relevant clauses in the contracts to specify that the price lists are merely recommended , and not compulsory , and that the price to be applied for resale is to be determined by the retailer .
Further , the Commission 's investigation established that Panamco Tica was lending refrigerators to retailers and attaching exclusivity clauses to the contracts , which required retailers to use the refrigerator for Coca Cola products exclusively .
The Commission was of the view that as Coca Cola products were among the markets leaders , and given the importance of selling a cold product to the consumer , this practice had a direct effect on small retailers , which had no space to install a second refrigerator .
In the context of a market with a high number of small retailers this practice can be seen as a barrier to entry .
The Commission sanctioned Panamco Tica by banning it from agreeing , imposing or including any exclusivity clause in contracts with customers with regard to the use of refrigeration equipment in places where there is no space to install a second refrigerator .
The Coca Cola Company was not investigated in this case , as it is not based in Costa Rica .
However , the Commission is currently investigating its subsidiary , the Coca Cola Interamerican Corporation .
Commentary
This case shows the effects that resale price maintenance can have in developing countries .
In a small market scenario much as in Costa Rica , small businesses are very important as an engine of growth .
While large market economies are moving towards making resale price maintenance a rule - of - reason issue , rather than a per se illegal practice , such practices harm small economies like Costa Rica .
Therefore , competition authorities have to evaluate critically the effects of these practices , and this is easier when the law provides for a per se illegal situation .
Panamco Tica as a dominant player in the Costa Rica market was also able to restrict interbrand competition by entering into exclusive contracts with retailers concerning the cold storage facility provided to them .
This creates barriers to entry for small firms and also limits consumer choices .
Mergers and acquisitions
South Africa : Merger in the health care services market prohibited
Brief description
On 30 June 2005 , the Competition Commission recommended to the Competition Tribunal that a proposed merger involving Medicross Healthcare Group ( Pty ) Ltd and Prime Cure Holdings ( Pty ) Ltd be prohibited on the ground that it raises serious competition and public interest concerns .
Both Medicross and Prime Cure are active in the area of managed health care services , which include the full spectrum of primary health care services , for example day - to - day GP services , dentistry , optometry , radiology and pathology .
Both have medical centres throughout the country and have extended networks of health - care service practitioners through which they provide their managed care products and services to members of medical schemes .
Medicross and Prime Cure have , however , targeted different types of end consumers , with Prime Cure focusing mainly on low - income consumers and Medicross on middle - to - high - income consumers .
Apart from Medicross and Prime Cure , there is only one other market participant of significant size active in this area , namely Carecross . Carecross , like Prime Cure , focuses on low - income consumers .
The Commission held the view that the market for managed care services provided on a national scale is highly concentrated .
It was also of the view that the barriers to entry into this market are high , as a result of which future entry is unlikely .
The future growth of the South African primary health care industry is expected to come from the millions of South Africans who currently are employed , but do not have any health insurance .
The Government and the industry face the challenge of creating affordable medical aid products for these citizens , generally referred to in the industry as the emerging market .
The Commission found that Prime Cure is well positioned to service the bottom segment of the market , since it already targets low - income consumers and that Medicross is a potential competitor for Prime Cure in servicing those consumers .
Therefore , the proposed deal is likely to result in the removal of a potential competitor in the bottom segment of the managed care services market in South Africa and reduce the number of potential players in this industry to the detriment of consumers and competition in general .
From a public interest perspective , the proposed merger is likely to negatively affect the ability of small firms and firms controlled by historically disadvantaged persons to become competitive in this market .
Furthermore , it is likely to have a negative impact on the broader health - care industry in restricting the transfer of individuals from public health - care facilities to private health - care facilities .
A further issue of concern relates to the already vertically integrated structure of Netcare , which would be further strengthened by the proposed merger .
The Commission therefore concluded that the proposed merger is likely to substantially prevent or lessen competition and would have a negative impact on public interests , and therefore recommended that the Tribunal prohibit the merger .
Commentary
From its inception in 1999 to date the South African Competition Commission has reviewed in excess of 1,000 mergers .
Of all these , the Commission and the Competition Tribunal have on average rejected no more than 2 per cent , which indicates that the merger regulation environment in South Africa is one that is very permissive .
This should bring a great deal of comfort to business .
Merger analysis has been tackled well over the past five years and the challenge remains to continue this approach consistently , with firms and foreign investors being provided with a level of certainty that they are able to factor in whenever they have to make decisions on investment in the South African economy .
At the same time , it is important to give new entrants and smaller players reassurance that they too can enter and function profitably in markets that were previously difficult to enter because of anti-competitive practices .
Republic of Korea : Corrective measures imposed on merger between conglomerates
Brief description
After deliberating on Hite Brewery Co. 's bid for Jinro Ltd. , the Korean Fair Trade Commission ( KFTC ) decided in July 2005 that it would impose corrective measures in the event of Hite 's formal notification of the takeover on the ground that the conglomerate merger between the Republic of Korea 's largest beer maker and it s top soju producer might substantially harm competition .
Soju is an alcoholic beverage that originates in Korea . The main ingredient is rice , almost always in combination with others such as wheat , barley or sweet potatoes .
As to market definition , the KFTC defined the soju market and the beer market as separate markets , taking into consideration various aspects .
For example , the two types of liquor are different in terms of taste , percentage of alcohol and consumption pattern .
In addition , the SSNIP Test results showed there is no substitute relationship between soju and beer .
The KFTC , however , decided that there are great concerns about competition restriction through control over the distribution network because the beer and soju markets use the same distribution channel ( liquor wholesalers ) .
First , after the merger , the combined company might abuse its strengthened market dominance to raise prices of its beer and soju products , directly reducing consumer benefits .
Second , the merger is expected to give the combined company more distribution power to engage in unfair practices such as bundling .
This may ultimately lead to exclusion of existing competitors from competition in the two liquor markets .
Third , as the combined company secured a strong distribution channel , new liquor makers would find it more difficult to enter the two markets .
The decision came after Hite applied for a pre-merger review on acquiring shares in Jinro .
The KFTC 's corrective measures are as follows :
The combined company should not raise prices of alcoholic beverages by more than the average inflation rate for the next five years , and if it wants to , it must have prior consultation with the KFTC .
The combined company should submit , and receive KFTC 's approval for , detailed measures to keep it from unfairly coercing / inducing liquor wholesalers to transact with it and making a transaction with them by unfairly taking advantage of its position in the business area , and should comply with the measures for five years .
The combined company should manage its sales workforce and corporate structure separately over the next five years .
The combined company should report to the KFTC all its records of transactions with liquor wholesalers .
Commentary
The KFTC 's decision acknowledged that a conglomerate merger can have anti-competitive effects on the market and can be evaluated in order to impose ex-ante and ex-post monitoring measures at the same time , so that the adverse effect of competition restriction can be corrected appropriately while the positive effect of enhanced efficiency can be maximized .
However , it is important to note that ex-post monitoring can be very expensive , with competition authorities with limited resources being prevented , from handling new cases or ending up not following up on the undertakings entered into by the parties .
It is therefore important to balance the factors that come into play in a particular case .
Zimbabwe : Joint venture business operations in the furniture industry
Brief description
The Zimbabwe Competition and Tariff Commission in July 2004 received notification of the proposed joint venture business operations between Tedco Industries Limited , a company involved in the manufacturing and retailing of furniture products , appliances and clothing , and Steinhoff Africa Limited of South Africa , a company involved in furniture manufacturing and distribution .
The proposed transaction entailed the formation in Zimbabwe of two joint venture companies involved in the manufacture and distribution of furniture .
Examination of the proposed merger was largely based on information submitted by the merging parties in the merger application form .
Additional information was obtained from other major stakeholders , which included suppliers , competitors and customers of the merging parties , as well as the relevant industry association in Zimbabwe .
The Competition Commission of South Africa was also consulted on Steinhoff Africa Limited and its market in South Africa .
The transaction was considered to be largely a horizontal merger with some vertical elements between the merging parties ' furniture manufacturing and retailing operations .
The relevant product market was identified as the manufacturing and distribution of ( a ) bedding ; ( b ) case goods ; ( c ) upholstered lounge suites ; and ( d ) furniture products , while the relevant geographical market was identified as the whole of Zimbabwe since that is the market on which the merger would have a significant impact .
Tedco Industries ' pre-merger share of the relevant product markets was . ( i ) 65 per cent of the bedding market ; ( ii ) 36 per cent of the furniture products market ; ( iii ) 24 per cent of the case goods market ; and ( iv ) 11 per cent of the upholstered lounge suites market
The Commission noted that the transaction would not result in a reduction in the number of players , and therefore competition , in the relevant market .
The transaction would in fact result in the creation of two new furniture - manufacturing companies .
It was also noted that the transaction had a number of public interest benefits , such as ( i ) foreign direct investment ; ( ii ) foreign currency generation through exports ; ( iii ) additional employment creation ; and ( iv ) technology improvement in the local Zimbabwean furniture industry .
Some stakeholders had expressed concerns about the transaction , including the following :
The exporting arm of the joint venture would deprive the local Zimbabwean market of furniture items .
The joint venture would acquire firms in the upstream market , thereby foreclosing access to raw materials by competing furniture manufacturers .
If the joint venture imports completely - knocked - down ( CKD ) furniture kits , it would out -compete other manufacturers as it would produce more furniture at less cost than the other manufacturers .
Steinhoff is dominant in the neighbouring South African market and might abuse that position dominance in the Zimbabwean market by undercutting prices or becoming a price leader .
The Commission nevertheless found these concerns to be more a fear of competition than of actual anti-competitive practices .
The merger was approved on the ground that it raised no serious competition concerns through the substantial lessening of competition in Zimbabwe or the creation of a monopoly situation .
It was however , agreed that in view of the stakeholder concerns expressed about the transaction , the operation of the joint venture should be closely monitored against the possibility of any future anti-competitive behaviour .
Commentary
This case exemplifies cooperation and exchange of information between competition authorities .
The analysis of the case shows that the benefits of the merger outweigh the concerns of the stakeholders .
However , the competition authority kept an open window to monitor the activities of the joint venture in view of the stakeholders ' submissions .
For developing countries to be able to have competition law enforcement credibility , resources both financial and human should be available for undertaking compliance follow - up .
Norway : Intervention in merger between American drilling equipment companies
Brief description
The Norwegian Competition Authority has intervened against the merger between two American drilling equipment companies , National Oilwell Inc. and Varco International Inc. National . The two companies merged in March 2005 , and Varco shareholders received National Oilwell shares in exchange for Varco shares .
Both National Oilwell and Varco have subsidiaries in Norway , and were well established in the supply of drilling equipment and services for the Norwegian Continental Shelf before the merger .
They were the leading companies globally in providing systems and equipment for oil and gas drilling .
The merged company would have had a very strong position in the drilling equipment market .
The Authority warned that the merger would restrict competition in the markets for equipment and components used in oil and gas drilling and production , and thus the merged company has to divest itself of National Oilwell 's Norwegian subsidiaries active in drilling equipment sales and service .
Accordingly , the Norwegian Competition Authority ordered the sale of National Oilwell 's Norwegian subsidiaries active in drilling equipment sales and services on 22 June 2005 .
Commentary
This case is an example of cross - border anti-competitive mergers ' spillover effects emanating from other jurisdictions .
Effective enforcement of competition law can prevent the likely adverse effects by prohibiting such mergers , allowing them with conditions or issuing divest orders , as may be provided by the relevant competition law provisions .
Mergers of subsidiaries of companies originating from other jurisdictions usually affect developing countries , when presented with the argument that the parent companies have already merged elsewhere .
The current case illustrates that competition authorities should evaluate the effects of mergers on their markets and resolve cases on the basis of that analysis .
The Norwegian Competition Authority successfully used this procedure to ensure that the market remained competitive .
Argentina : Conditional approval of telecommunications merger
Brief description
50 In November 2004 , the National Competition Commission of Argentina recommended conditional approval of the transaction between Bellsouth Corporation ( an American company ) and Telefónica Móviles ( a subsidiary of the Spanish group Telefonica ) .
Telefónica Móviles had notified the Commission of its intention to acquire the assets of Bellsouth Corporation 's Latin American operations .
The Commission 's analysis found that the acquisition would have both horizontal and vertical implications , as both parties were involved in a number of overlapping markets , including mobile telecommunications , fixed local telephony , long - distance fixed telephony , Internet access services , data transmission services and , public telephone services .
An analysis of the horizontal implications revealed that the transaction raised no serious competition concerns as the market for the provision of these services was highly competitive and the merged entity would not enjoy a large market share .
However , the Commission found that the merged entity would have a combined spectrum of 85 mghz , which is above the maximum of 50 mghz allowed by law .
The Commission required the merged entity to reduce its concentration of spectrum from 85 mghz to 50 mghz in a reasonable period of time , which was to be determined by the telecommunications regulator .
The Commission also held that since the mobile interconnection rate would be regulated in future , the merged entity would not be able to abuse its position in that market ; however as an interim measure , the Commission approved the transaction on condition that the merged entity did not charge interconnection fees on a discriminatory basis .
The Commission also required the merged entity to continue providing public phone line contracts to providers of public telephony on a non-discriminatory basis .
Commentary
The telecommunications industry worldwide is experiencing technological and regulatory changes leading to new products and services not only in telecommunications , but also in industries that use telecommunications products as inputs , such as computers and data retrieval .
Of late , the world has seen a growing number of significant mergers and acquisitions in telecommunications .
While such transactions may be a legitimate response to economic needs , they may , in other instances , threaten competition and the rights of consumers .
In developing countries in particular , an alert merger policy is important so that these transactions do not result in unilateral or collusive anti-competitive effects , which would hinder the development process .

[ Original : French ]
Note verbale dated 28 April 2005 from the Permanent Mission of Benin to the United Nations addressed to the Chairman of the Counter - Terrorism Committee
The Permanent Mission of the Republic of Benin to the United Nations presents its compliments to the United Nations and has the honour to transmit the attached second report of Benin on measures taken in implementation of Security Council resolution 1373 ( 2001 ) ( see enclosure ) .
Enclosure
[ Original : French ]
Second report of the Republic of Benin in implementation of Security Council resolution 1373 ( 2001 ) on counter - terrorism
Subparagraph 1 ( a )
Legal or other measures to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts
In implementation of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism ( New York , 1999 ) , Benin has integrated the suppression of the financing of terrorism in all its forms into its positive law .
The draft Penal Code stipulates in article 567 bis , paragraph 2 , that the procedure for freezing , seizure or confiscation of assets belonging to or intended for a terrorist group or derived from a terrorist act shall be that provided under the Act on capital .
Currently , no specific act in Benin 's legislation requires the notary or attorney to report the fraudulent origin of suspicious transactions .
By Decree No. 2004-359 of 24 June 2004 , the Government of Benin submitted to the National Assembly the anti-money - laundering bill , essentially a community text valid in all the States members of the West African Economic and Monetary Union ( WAEMU ) .
The bill covers the definition , prevention , detection and suppression of money - laundering .
The implementation of the law happens through the signing of the decree establishing the National Financial Information Processing Unit ( CENTIF ) , after the adoption and promulgation of the above - mentioned Act , that will enable close cooperation between CENTIF and administrative and judicial bodies in seeking evidence regarding money - laundering activities , the imposition of administrative and disciplinary measures and criminal penalties .
The repressive provisions of the Act concern investigative measures , the lifting of professional secrecy , administrative and disciplinary sanctions , interim measures of protection by the State ( seizure or confiscation of assets relating to the violation ) , freezing of assets and financial operations concerning such assets , prison sentences of three to seven years and fines equal to three times the amount of the assets or funds that were the subject of the money - laundering operation .
Attempted money - laundering is punishable by the same sentence and , in the presence of aggravating circumstances , these sentences are doubled .
Furthermore , a new counterfeiting act was adopted by the Parliament during October 2003 .
Thus all economic offences likely to be used to launder money are increasingly becoming a subject of concern to the Government of Benin .
Subparagraph 1 ( b )
The legal measures taken by Benin for the suppression of terrorism are :
- Review of the regulations concerning transfer of funds abroad in the WAEMU area in the context of the Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism .
- In those regulations , henceforward neither the State nor individuals may transfer funds for the benefit of private individuals .
The new law requires that deposits must be made on behalf of legal persons duly registered with the competent body .
Subparagraph 1 ( c )
At the administrative level , CENTIF may , based on serious and reliable reports in its possession which can be corroborated , oppose the execution of a transaction within the deadline mentioned by the declarer .
In the legal area ( investigative measures ) , the examining magistrate may order various actions , in accordance with the law , for a fixed time period , without professional secrecy being invoked , in particular :
- The monitoring of bank accounts and similar accounts , when there are serious indications giving reason to suspect that they are being utilized or could be utilized for operations connected to the original infraction or other infractions under the law .
- Access to network systems and computer servers utilized or likely to be utilized by individuals when there are serious indications of their participation in the original infraction or other infractions under the law .
- The communication of authentic or private instruments and banking , financial and commercial documents .
It may also order the seizure of the above - mentioned instruments and documents .
The examining magistrate may order interim measures of protection , in accordance with the prevailing law , at State expense , in particular the seizure or confiscation of assets related to the infraction which is under investigation and any evidence allowing them to be identified , as well as freezing of sums of money and financial operations having to do with those assets .
The lifting of these measures may be ordered by the examining magistrate under the conditions provided by law .
Subparagraph 2 ( a )
The draft Penal Code provides for the suppression of terrorism in all its forms , in implementation of the United Nations conventions to which Benin is a party .
Important legal measures concerning weapons have been taken :
The law governing the sale , manufacture , possession , transport and stockpiling of weapons within Benin is Decree No. 61-31/PR/M1 / AM of 7 February 1961 concerning the weapons and ammunition regime in the Republic of Benin .
In application of this Decree , each year the Minister of the Interior draws up an order establishing the quota of advanced weapons that may be authorized for import .
It should be noted that the provisions of the above - mentioned Decree do not allow an effective response to the policy of combating the proliferation of light weapons to which Benin has adhered through its participation in the ECOWAS Moratorium on the Importation , Exportation and Manufacture of Light Weapons .
For this reason , the Government has just introduced a bill to harmonize its administrative and legislative measures with those of other member countries of ECOWAS under the Programme for Coordination and Assistance for Security and Development ( PECASED ) .
As for legal measures on explosives , their import and sale are governed by a State monopoly granted to the Ministry of Mines , Energy and Hydraulics ( MMEH ) .
The legislation in this area consists in the following :
- The code on explosives ;
- Decree No. 99-281 of 21 May 1999 on approval of the statute of the Benin Office of Geographic and Mining Research ( OBRGM ) ;
- Order No. 032/MMEH/DC/CTMII/OBM/DDM of 17 November 1992 amending Order No. 115/MTPT/DMGM of 22 November 1973 granting the State monopoly for the import and sale of explosives in the Republic of Benin to the Office of Mines , Geology and Hydrocarbons .
The bill establishing the weapons and ammunition regime which was under study by the National Legislation Commission in September 2004 governs the issue .
Controlling the proliferation of light weapons .
Control takes place on two levels :
( a ) The category of advanced weapons
In this category , imports are regulated by the above legislation .
Owners are known , registered and monitored .
( b ) Locally produced weapons
The Commission undertook a census of local weapons manufacturers in the country in order to regulate their activities .
Articles 90 and 91 suppress and define terrorist acts .
Article 90 — The following infractions , when they are related to an individual or collective action for the purpose of seriously undermining public order through intimidation or terror , constitute acts of terrorism :

Theft , extortion , destruction , degradation and damage , as well as computer - related offences ;
The manufacture or possession of lethal or explosive machines or devices ;
The production , sale , importation or exportation of explosives ;
The acquisition , possession , transport or illicit carriage of explosives or explosive devices ;
Possession , carriage or transport of weapons of war and munitions ;
The development , manufacture , possession , stockpiling , acquisition and transfer of biological or toxic weapons .
Article 91 — The act of introduction into the atmosphere , soil or subsoil or waters , including territorial waters , of a substance that can endanger the health of humans or animals or the environment also constitutes an act of terrorism when it is linked to an individual or collective endeavour to cause serious disruption to public order through intimidation or terror .
Articles 92 to 94 contain the related penalties .
Article 92 . All acts of terrorism are subject to the death penalty .
Article 93 . Any person attempting to commit an act of terrorism is exempt from punishment if , having warned the administrative or judicial authorities , that person has been able to prevent the commission of the offence and to identify the other perpetrators , if any .
Article 94 . The sentence of imprisonment imposed on the perpetrator of an act of terrorism or his accomplice shall be reduced by half if , by warning the administrative or judicial authorities , he has made it possible to terminate the criminal activity or to prevent the offence from causing death or permanent injury and to identify other perpetrators , if any .
When the sentence imposed is life imprisonment , it shall be reduced to a term of 20 years .
Subparagraph 2 ( d )
Preventing the use of the territory of Benin to commit terrorist acts from abroad .
- The Constitution ;
- Conventions ( ECOWAS , African Union , United Nations , etc. )
Subparagraph 2 ( e )

At the international level
With the United Nations
Benin participated actively in the elaboration of the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Additional Protocols , signed them on 13 December 2000 in Palermo and ratified them on 1 March 2004 .
The work of internalizing them is nearing completion .
Technical support from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) at Vienna made this possible , along with its participation in the Bamako Seminar of November 2003 .
With the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA )
Benin participates regularly in seminars held by IAEA on strengthening of the safeguards system , nuclear security , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , physical protection of nuclear materials , management of radioactive waste , etc .
Benin requested assistance for the implementation of legal instruments on protection against nuclear terrorism .
With the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
As a party to the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons , Benin , which considers chemical weapons to be weapons of mass destruction , participates in meetings organized by the Technical Secretariat of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on various aspects of the development , manufacture , stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and their destruction .
At the regional level
Benin ratified the OAU Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism on 1 March 2004 . With the support of the International Organization of la Francophonie ( OIF ) , it also took part in the Cairo regional seminar in early September 2003 .
At the subregional level
Benin participates actively in the efforts of ECOWAS and WAEMU in West Africa .
The meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.
Agenda item 62 ( continued )
Social development , including questions relating to the world social situation and to youth , ageing , disabled persons and the family
Two plenary meetings devoted to the evaluation of the progress made in the implementation of the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond
Reports of the Secretary - General ( A/60/61 , A/60/133 and Corr.1 , and A/60/156 )
Draft resolution ( A/60 / L.2 )
Ms. Mouro ( Portugal ) ( spoke in French ) : On behalf of the Portuguese Government , I have been designated to represent Portuguese youth during this special meeting of the General Assembly devoted to youth .
I wish to associate myself with the statement made by the youth representative of the United Kingdom on behalf of the European Union .
In recent years much work has been done to reaffirm youth policies , particularly as concerns the objectives set out in the World Programme of Action for Youth , including the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) .
As citizens of the world , we want to express our ideas and feelings and to create the necessary conditions for the participation of young people in society .
We believe that we need more than just recognition .
Young people represent an important social group and should enjoy the right to participate and state their views on all aspects of society relevant to them .
It is not enough to have a youth policy .
Young people must to be involved in the formulation and implementation of the policies that affect them , including through credible , accountable , autonomous and independent youth organizations .
The promotion of the protection of , and respect for , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all young people form the basis of our national youth policy .
It is of utmost importance that human rights be implemented and safeguarded in order to improve young people 's lives as well as ensure their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .
With regard to the implementation of the World Programme of Action for Youth , the Portuguese Government , together with the National Youth Council , has developed developing a series of activities and projects aimed at the Programme 's implementation .
We held a seminar on “ Young people and sexuality ” , whose conclusions reiterated the importance and urgency of campaigns to inform young people about sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS , as well as unplanned pregnancy .
We have recently relaunched our “ Different but equal ” campaign , which addresses the problems of xenophobia , racism and cultural and gender discrimination .
Sustainable development is also a key issue for us .
We have published a book on the topic that has been distributed in schools throughout the country and has been made available to all youth institutions .
That book will serve as a tool to raise the awareness of , and sensitize Portuguese youth to , that issue .
The Portuguese youth policy takes a cross-sectoral approach and encompasses important areas affecting young peoples ' lives .
In recent years , the Portuguese Government , in close cooperation with the National Youth Council , supported the holding of significant international youth meetings , particularly the World Youth Festival ; the first World Conference of Ministers Responsible for Youth , which issued the Lisbon Declaration ; the Community of Portuguese - speaking Countries Youth Conference ; and the most recent consultative meeting on the 10 - year review of the World Programme of Action for Youth , held at Coimbra last January , which issued a number of recommendations on the Programme of Action .
During the Coimbra meeting , we had the opportunity , for the first time , to engage in a genuine exchange of views between United Nations agencies and youth organizations on the implementation of the Programme .
At the international level , our National Youth Council has been cooperating with the Community of Portuguese - speaking Countries on two objectives .
The first relates to the mobility of young Portuguese speakers , and the second is a project aimed at informing , warning and educating young people about HIV / AIDS .
We have done a great deal over the past 10 years to promote and implement the World Programme of Action , but much more must be done .
We will continue to do our share to achieve the goals that are our common responsibility .
The participation of young people in decision - making processes is one of the key priority areas of the United Nations agenda on youth .
We therefore urge national Governments to continue to include youth representatives in their national delegations to important international events , including sessions of the General Assembly and of the Commission for Social Development .
Youth representatives can take home to their respective countries knowledge that can then be transmitted to other young people , there by creating an opportunity to motivate increasing numbers of young people to become involved in the shaping of their future .
Youth representatives can also make significant inputs to discussions held in the context of various institutions .
We will continue our work and remain committed to working with international institutions .
We are cooperating with , among others , the European Youth Forum .
We reaffirm the commitments we have undertaken in the context of the World Programme of Action for Youth and its five priorities .
We remain committed to the Millennium Development Goals , and we ask the United Nations to assist Member States and youth organizations in the implementation of a comprehensive , cross-sectoral youth policy capable of reaching young people everywhere .
Young people must be considered part of the solution , and not a problem .
The President : Before giving the floor to the next speaker , I should like to inform members that there are a large number of speakers on our list for this meeting .
In order to accommodate all the speakers , and taking into account that we must allow time for the consideration of draft resolution A /60 / L.2 , and for the exercise of the right of reply , I strongly urge speakers to limit their statements to four minutes .
Ms. Taracena Secaira ( Guatemala ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : I should like at the outset to reiterate what was expressed by the representative of Argentina on behalf of the Rio Group , who explained the situation of young people in the region .
To evaluate the situation of the world 's young people is to evaluate the future of the world .
It is to analyse where we are and where we want to go , because today 's young people represent the future of humanity and of the world .
If , as stated in the report of the Secretary - General ( A/60/61 ) , young people represent 18 per cent of the world 's population and 85 per cent of them live in developing countries , the future is in our hands .
That is a great responsibility not only for our own countries , but for everyone .
It is a challenge that is not only national , but global .
Guatemala has understood that very well .
That is why , two years ago , we launched the national youth policy , aimed at the comprehensive and sustainable development of the Guatemalan young people participating in it .
Although young people represent 70 per cent of my country 's current population , they did not have access to comprehensive strategies or programmes until now .
This is the first national youth policy that has been established in Guatemala . We are proud to have developed it with broad participation by representatives of my country 's diverse ethnic and linguistic groups and with the assistance of an interagency coordination effort .
Participating in its creation were 10 ministries ; three State secretariats ; the Supreme Court of Justice ; 48 youth representatives of the linguistic communities of the Mayan , Garifuna and Xinca peoples , as proposed by the Mayan Language Academy of Guatemala ; the Council of the Xinca People and the Organization of Black Guatemalans ; 12 youth representatives of the political parties ; and 311 civil society organizations active in areas pertaining to youth — all of them under the coordination of the National Youth Council of Guatemala .
Through the policy , we seek to implement the principles of solidarity and inclusion of President Oscar Berger Perdomo 's governmental plan for 2004 - 2008 — whose agenda accords priority to young people and to the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond — and to assist in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals .
We are aware that we can achieve the Goals only if all sectors of society are involved .
The policy 's purpose is to direct the efforts of the State towards improving young people 's quality of life , promoting their comprehensive development and broadening their opportunities to build unity in diversity and to become good citizens .
We need young people to take responsibility for facilitating and making the transition from lacking access to opportunities to fully exercising their rights and citizenship .
The national youth policy is based on four principles : the principle of human rights , in which young people are seen as having individual and collective civil , political , cultural , economic and social rights ; the principle of multiculturalism , which recognizes the diversity of the peoples and cultures that together form one nation and that build unity out of diversity , knowledge , understanding and mutual respect among the various cultures and civilizations that are a basic characteristic of my country ; the principle of sustainability , which sets out basic guidelines for sustainable development , as they relate to economic organization , the relationship with the natural environment , social and political organization and cultural aspects ; and the principle of intergenerational cooperation , which fosters relations of solidarity , cooperation and mutual respect among various age groups , recognizing that each group has important values to share with and teach to other generations .
The national youth policy focuses on six areas : gender , the life cycle , comprehensiveness and inclusion , the family , the multisectoral approach and territoriality .
It also has 11 components , including citizen participation , multiculturalism , community security and justice , scientific and technological education and development , integral and differentiated health care , employment and work , and starting a business and competitiveness .
We are pleased that the draft resolution on which we will take a decision at this meeting will emphasize the importance of employment and work .
Our young people need decent work that will remove them from the risks and dangers of idleness , which include frustration , vagrancy , drug abuse , HIV / AIDS infection , gang membership , violence and delinquency .
I can not fail to emphasize that during the process of elaborating Guatemala 's national youth policy , a gender perspective was incorporated as a norm for participation , requiring equal numbers of women and men from all participating organizations .
Guatemalan young people thus provided us with a valuable lesson that should be taken into account by the rest of society .
Nor can I fail to mention the national and international cooperative entities that took part in this process , including the Guatemalan Indigenous Development Fund , the United Nations Population Fund , UNICEF , the German Agency for Technical Cooperation and the Iberoamerican Youth Organization .
Many thanks go to all of them .
Finally , I must tell the Assembly how much I regret having been the one to make this statement in this Hall , because my Government would have preferred that a representative of Guatemalan youth could have come .
But the problem was a lack of resources , not a lack of willingness .
That is why we support the initiative to create a United Nations youth fund that would facilitate economic assistance for youth representatives of developing countries and give them the opportunity to participate in all United Nations forums directly concerning them . However , I am very proud to have been able to share with members what young people are doing in Guatemala .
Mr. Chaimongkol ( Thailand ) : At the outset , my delegation would like to extend a very warm welcome to all the youth representatives , whose young faces remind us of the very purpose of our gathering here today .
My delegation welcomes the Secretary - General 's World Youth Report 2005 ( A/60/61 ) , and his report on the global analysis and evaluation of national action plans on youth employment ( A/60/133 ) . Both of those reports are comprehensive and can serve as suitable starting points for further discussions on the situation of youth today .
That fact inevitably hinders the development process and increases the vulnerability of youth to other kinds of social and political problems , including drug addiction and trafficking , human smuggling and trafficking , and recruitment into armed conflicts .
In 2002 , Thailand adopted a national policy and 10 - year plan of action on children and youth to promote the role of the family in supporting and building the capacity of young persons .
In addition , various organizations that promote youth development have been supported and encouraged to coordinate their activities .
Most importantly , the national policy and plan of action aim to empower young persons themselves with the relevant skills and knowledge so that they can make informed choices and decisions on matters relating to their own lives , as well as to society as a whole .
Youth is a critical period in life .
It is when we make that important transition from childhood into adulthood .
Young persons are full of aspirations , energy , and potential .
They can contribute to all aspects of society 's development .
It is therefore crucial that we do not squander this opportunity to invest in the future .
We must ensure that the basic needs and rights of the world 's youth are guaranteed , so that they may attain their aspirations , fully utilize their energy , and fulfil their potential .
The ways and means may vary according to the situations of each society , but our objective must be the same : to empower our youth , so that they may contribute to creating a more peaceful , prosperous and democratic world .
Ms. Meena ( United Republic of Tanzania ) : I am honoured to read a statement on behalf of the young people of the United Republic of Tanzania , and I am grateful that the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania for giving us this opportunity to be heard .
We also thank the United Nations for giving youth delegates the opportunity to participate and request all Governments to continue to send youth delegates to future United Nations meetings .
Youth constitute almost a third of the total population of the United Republic of Tanzania , and comprise 65 per cent of the labour force .
We are thus a force to be reckoned with : we need to be heard in all decision - making processes , and to have youth issues mainstreamed into national development policies , strategies and programmes .
The Government of Tanzania has taken several measures to improve the situation of youth .
However , many challenges still remain .
Our country is still poor . It is confronted both with a heavy debt burden and a difficult struggle against diseases such as HIV / AIDS and malaria that affect a large segment of the youth population .
Assisting the capacity of the Government to implement the Millennium Development Goals and the World Programme of Action on Youth is , in the end , to support our youth .
The majority of my fellow young people live in rural areas .
Addressing the inequities and imbalances in development opportunities between rural and urban areas has to be given priority in order to curb the problem of rural - to - urban immigration .
In view of a growing trend in this area , we are observing rapid growth in the urban informal sector and an increase in the incidence of hazardous employment and crime .
Productive and decent work for young people has to be addressed as a strategy in poverty reduction and sustainable development .
There is thus also a need to foster day - to - day growth of the informal sector through entrepreneurship development , infrastructure development and provision of capital .
We agree with the observation that globalization creates both opportunities and challenges .
We need to be able to enhance our effective participation as well as increase our capacities to take advantage of opportunities in the national and global economies .
If the quality of education in our countries is not improved and the digital divide not bridged , youth in the developing countries will continue to be spectators and will remain excluded from the economy .
As young people , we recognize that we too have responsibilities to be good citizens , to respect the rule of law in our societies and to contribute to the welfare of our communities .
It is important for us to be organized and strive to participate fully in the social , economic , cultural and political life of our nations .
To do so , we need mentoring and support .
I wish to conclude by stating that political will and commitment at the highest level nationally and internationally are of primary importance in creating an enabling environment for youth empowerment . We urge our societies and Governments to consider us as assets , not as problems .
Please give us space and opportunities .
Mr. Kitaoka ( Japan ) : Ten years after the adoption of the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond , there have been significant developments in the priority areas of the Programme .
However , the current generation of young people is facing even more complicated challenges than those envisaged 10 years ago .
Japanese society has been undergoing a rapid transformation from its traditionally homogeneous nature to one that is more individualistic , due partly to the globalization of the economy , as well as to the advent of information technology , which has resulted in increased use of the Internet and of cellular phones .
In addition , a changing demographic structure has created more single - person households and one - child families as a result of our lower birth rate and ageing population .
In order to promote sound development for the young people who will lead the nation and contribute to international society in the twenty - first century , it is important to appropriately take into account today 's social environment and take drastic action to that end as we formulate national youth development policy .
While Japan has the good fortune of having a high educational level , a side effect of this has been that we have fallen slightly behind in our commitment to a national youth development policy .
In June 2003 , however , a headquarters for youth development was set up within a cabinet office .
In December 2003 — six months later — a national youth development policy , which articulates both basic principles and long - term Government policies , was adopted .
Taking the World Programme of Action fully into consideration , Japan also has been adopting measures for the development of youth in order to foster such human qualities as independence , responsibility , solidarity and tolerance , and to promote awareness of human rights and the notion of living in a global society .
While actively committing itself to the formulation and implementation of a national youth policy , Japan is also firmly engaged in international cooperation and supports youth in developing countries by providing development assistance , as well as by engaging in international exchanges and volunteer activities .
For example , Japan has vigorously provided assistance in the field of education by building educational institutions , accepting teachers for training and dispatching experts , as well as by providing educational materials and classroom equipment .
In conclusion , the delegation of Japan strongly hopes that the review we are conducting at this meeting will contribute further to addressing the challenges facing youth and renewing the determination of every Member State to attain the goals of the World Programme of Action for Youth .
At this tenth anniversary of the World Programme of Action , I would like to quote from the address of the Secretary - General to the World Conference of Ministers Responsible for Youth in 1998 :
“ no one is born a good citizen ; no nation is born a democracy .
Rather , both are processes that continue to evolve over a lifetime .
Young people must be included from birth .
A society that cuts itself off from its youth severs its lifeline ” .
Mr. Ali ( Sudan ) ( spoke in Arabic ) : My delegation wishes to express its pleasure at participating in the work of this special session of the General Assembly , convened on the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond .
The convening of this session to review the efforts made and the progress achieved as regards the World Program of Action for Youth is clear evidence and a great affirmation of the growing concern paid by the international Organization and its Members to young people and of the space it sets aside in its programmes and plans for their concerns and various issues . Such importance was made necessary by the focus of attention being attracted by this segment of society , the young people who are pioneers in building nations and achieving renaissance , development and prosperity .
This special session is to consider a renewal of the pledge to the youth that their agenda , their aspirations and the challenges they face will remain at the forefront of the priorities , programmes and concerns of the United Nations .
Allow me here to pay tribute to the contents of the report of the Secretary - General , which adopted an integrated , comprehensive approach to the concerns of youth and the challenges facing them . The report also monitored the efforts made nationally and internationally with a view to achieving such objectives .
The five new concerns indicated supplement the priorities of the World Programme of Action so as to keep up with new developments and changes in the world arena . We welcome these five concerns ; they are of great interest to us .
In this context , we also welcome the resolution submitted this morning , and we affirm our full readiness to tackle such concerns through youth programmes , plans and policies , with resolve , will and sheer determination .
Our appreciation also goes to the Secretariat units working in this field for their efforts and solid preparation that culminated in holding this important meeting and the activities leading up to it .
The concerns , issues and aspirations of Sudanese youth occupy a high priority in our Government 's plans and programmes as an expression of our firm belief in the vital role of youth in progress and construction .
Here , we would like to refer briefly to increasing efforts to adopt the concerns and issues of youth , foremost of which are the major achievements resulting from the higher education revolution .
That “ revolution ” increased the annual enrolment in universities from 12,000 in 1995 to 25,000 in the year 2000 . This year , the number of male and female students who were accepted in the various higher education institutions has exceeded 40,000 .
Various universities and institutions of higher learning have experienced a major breakthrough with the number of universities increasing from only five in 1995 to more than 40 in 2005 .
In the context of combating unemployment , training youth in various crafts and professions and providing opportunities and means of production , the State has adopted a major project upon the initiative of and in coordination with the Union for National Youth , one of the largest youth organizations in the Sudan .
This project , entitled “ Choosing the means of livelihood ” , is being undertaken under the generous auspices of His Excellency the President ; and its implementation has reached an advance stage .
There are efforts to eradicate technological illiteracy by creating information centres and providing computers and creating youth and sports clubs . Youth have undertaken pioneer projects to defeat malaria and to create awareness of the adverse effects of drugs . They have also set up environmental and conservation programmes .
The signing of the Sudan Comprehensive Peace Agreement put an end to the war in the South and threw the doors wide open to a promising future of good tidings and hope for all Sudanese people . This brings hope for development , stability and prosperity .
As is their wont , youth have been at the forefront in implementing programmes for the culture of peace and confidence - building and strengthening and in leading reconstruction and restoring normalcy .
In conclusion , I would like to take this opportunity to convey to this World Youth Meeting the greetings and appreciation of Sudanese youth and their aspirations for a productive partnership with all youth around the world in order to promote the peace efforts in the Sudan through reconstruction , the promise of peace , development , prosperity and well - being .
Mr. Gill ( India ) : At the outset , please allow me to express our deep appreciation to the President of the General Assembly for his introductory remarks .
I would also like to thank him for providing us this opportunity to review the progress made at the plenary level in implementation of the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond .
My delegation wishes to take this opportunity to reaffirm its support for the initiatives taken by the United Nations for all - round development of youth so that they become key agents for social change , economic development and technological innovation .
India is an ancient civilization but a young society .
Nearly 56 per cent of the population is below the age of 24 .
India has been cognizant of the significant role of youth in national reconstruction and social change .
Accordingly , national youth policies have been developed for composite and all - round development to enable them to develop a wider national perspective and to keep them strong in heart , body and mind .
The thrust of our national youth policy centres on youth empowerment in different spheres of national life .
The youth development programmes devised in India over the years have focussed on personality development , qualities of citizenship , enhanced commitment to community service , social justice , self - reliance , national integration and humanism .
The Prime Minister of India , Mr. Manmohan Singh , has referred to youth as the building blocks of our nation .
He has drawn attention to the fact that the attitudes and outlook of youth on life and society play a determining role in shaping our destiny and our future .
Recognizing the importance of providing opportunities to the youth in particular , the Government of India has oriented its employment guarantee programmes to accommodate and provide for the aspirations of the growing numbers of young people that access the job market every year .
There is a special emphasis on those who are disadvantaged , such as poor and rural youth .
The National Rural Employment Act , passed by the Indian Parliament in August this year , for the first time makes the right to work a fundamental right .
The Rural Employment Guarantee scheme , thus created , provides 100 days of assured employment every year to every rural household .
The training of rural youth for self - employment scheme is designed to specifically train rural youth in skills to enable them to take up self - employment .
The scheme stipulates that at least 40 per cent of the beneficiaries should be women and 50 per cent from socially backward groups .
Elementary education is now a fundamental right in India .
The Government has resolved to increase public spending in education to at least six per cent of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
At least half of this amount would be spent in the development of primary and secondary education .
To pursue universal elementary education on a priority basis , Sarva Shiksha Abhiya , India 's universal elementary education scheme , was launched in 1998 , covering the entire country .
Education above the secondary level has a significant vocational training component so as to enable youth to acquire skills that would augment avenues for employment .
Nehru Yuva Kendras , national youth clubs , have spearheaded the youth movement in the country .
The health needs of the youth are at the core of development of the health infrastructure in India .
A holistic approach has been adopted , encompassing general , mental , physical and spiritual health of the young .
Among the priority areas , HIV / AIDS is no longer treated as just a health issue , but as a most serious socio - economic development issue .
Government spending on health has been increased , and it will be raised to two to three per cent of GDP over the next year .
My delegation would like to propose a special focus on youth employment in the work of the United Nations .
In that regard , we welcome the efforts of the Secretary - General to promote the Youth Employment Network and look forward to working with other delegations to ensure that the Network can be developed in the coming months .
The challenges ahead of us for the all - round development of youth are daunting .
But to be sure , with effective national and international efforts , they can be overcome .
Issues related to youth should be seen in the context of social and economic development in the age of the information revolution and globalization .
The Secretary - General 's report provides an incisive analysis on five new concerns related to youth : globalization , information and communication technology , HIV / AIDS and young people , youth and armed conflict and intergenerational problems .
My delegation will work with other delegations for the inclusion of those concerns in the World Programme of Action for Youth .
Mr. Puja ( Indonesia ) : My delegation is grateful for the comprehensive reports of the Secretary - General pertaining to progress in implementing the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond ( A/60/61 , A /60/133 , A/60/156 ) .
Our meeting is an opportune moment to review what has been accomplished and the obstacles encountered in implementing the World Programme since it was adopted 10 years ago .
My delegation notes significant progress made in a number of priority areas of the Programme of Action .
However , progress has been uneven in those areas , including at the country level , which should be cause for concern .
Further , Indonesia has noted that a number of complex challenges affecting youth have emerged since the inception of the Programme of Action in 1995 .
In line with the priority areas of the Programme of Action , the Indonesian Government , under the leadership of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , is using a triple - track strategy of pro-growth , pro-employment and pro-poor measures that strongly reflect a people - centred development approach .
That strategy includes measures to achieve greater sustainable economic growth through a combination of strong exports and increased domestic and foreign investment ; stimulate the performance of employment - generating sectors ; and promote the development of the rural economy and agriculture to alleviate poverty .
With that strategy , we aim , by 2009 , to reduce the unemployment rate from 9.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent and to cut the poverty rate by half , to 8.1 percent .
We also seek to attain a 6.6 per cent annual growth rate for the next five years , to be achieved through macroeconomic stability , fiscal sustainability and financial sector reforms .
Additional resources will be allocated for social sector programmes and infrastructure development .
An integral part of the triple - track strategy is our pro-employment policy , which plays a significant role in the well - being of youth in Indonesia .
As a lead country in the Secretary - General 's initiative of the Youth Employment Network , Indonesia , in cooperation with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs , convened a regional workshop on youth in poverty in South - East Asia from 2 to 4 August 2004 in Yogyakarta , involving participants at the Government and expert levels from Cambodia , Indonesia , Laos , Myanmar , the Philippines and Viet Nam . The workshop resulted in a number of significant inputs for the preparation of a review and action plans on youth employment , which is under our consideration at the present session .
With the support of the International Labour Organization , Indonesia has adopted its youth employment action plan for 2004 - 2007 , which rests on four pillars : providing quality basic education to prepare youth for work , creating quality jobs for young men and women through formal sector job creation , fostering entrepreneurship and ensuring equal opportunities for young men and women .
In implementing that action plan , the Government of Indonesia has been working closely with local government to build a solid foundation to speed efforts to address youth employment .
The Government of Indonesia started the programme by conducting various awareness - raising campaigns .
Since its launch last year , progress on the implementation of the action plan has not slackened .
For example , Indonesia 's awareness - raising campaigns have focused on changing traditional perceptions of gender roles and the division of responsibilities between women and men .
That is being addressed through the revision of national curricula and national education in general .
Other initiatives exploring opportunities in emerging sectors such as tourism , mass media , health and education , environmental conservation , the service sector and information and communication technology are also being implemented .
Indonesia fully recognizes that information and communication technology represents a key driving force for growth and job creation in other sectors .
Meanwhile , the agro- industry sector is being improved in order to strengthen urban - rural linkages , which are critical for job creation , poverty reduction and combating hunger .
In conclusion , I would like to reaffirm Indonesia 's commitment to the World Programme of Action for Youth .
While Indonesia appreciates the ongoing support and cooperation provided by the relevant United Nations agencies , it looks forward to their further support for the five new areas of concern pertaining to youth .
Ms. Garant ( Canada ) ( spoke in French ) : Thank you for this opportunity to speak on behalf of the youth of Canada .
It is a great honour for me and my delegation to be here today to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond .
But it is much more than a celebration .
It is also a time to reflect on what has been done , what is being done and what should be done for young people around the world .
How the global community responds to those challenges will determine how well its young citizens will be able to fulfil their potential .
Canada recognizes the need to invest in its youth .
Such investments have contributed to Canada 's diversity , as well as to one of the highest standards of living in the world .
As my youth colleague Mathew Whynott likes to say , the young people of this world are the future , but we also have to remember that they are the present .
Canada therefore views the policies and programmes we initiate for youth today as a means to help us with the demographic challenges of tomorrow .
With an ageing workforce , we must maximize the participation and well - being of all Canadians .
In 2003 , there were more than 4 million Canadians between the ages of 15 and 24 , representing 14 per cent of our total population .
Approximately 4 per cent of those youth are aboriginal or indigenous , and they often live in rural and isolated areas and face serious socio-economic challenges , especially related to the lack of education and skills .
Immigrants and members of visible minority communities , who make up 28 per cent of Canadian youth , tend to live in major urban centres and face linguistic and cultural challenges .
While half of our youth are in post - secondary education , many without advanced education will face problems when entering a workforce where almost all jobs are now highly skilled .
Those issues are of major concern for Canada as it faces the impending retirement of its baby boomers and feels the increasing impacts of globalization .
Literacy is a crucial concern .
Consider only one statistic : those with the lowest literacy have an unemployment rate of 26 per cent as compared with 4 per cent for those with the highest .
Recent immigrants now take seven or eight years to catch up to the literacy levels of Canadians in their same age group .
As a result , they may face long - term incomes up to 20 per cent less than those born in Canada .
A recent report by Statistics Canada has revealed that a mere 1 per cent increase in the average literacy rate in Canada will lead to an increase of $ 18.4 billion in the gross domestic product .
It will drive prosperity , cultural inclusion , and social advancement .
Economic growth is another outcome of prioritizing education .
With literacy and proper skills training , a young person can go on to obtain a secure job that will contribute to the economic advancement of his or her community .
( spoke in English )
The Youth Employment Strategy is the Government of Canada 's commitment to helping young people , particularly those facing barriers to employment .
That strategy was initially introduced in 1997 to address some of the challenges faced by youth in making a successful transition from school to work .
In 2003 it was realigned to focus on the value and need for skills , work experience and information to make sure that youth were ready to compete in the labour market of the twenty - first century , including through the acquisition of further education and skills development .
The Government of Canada is actively involved in engaging youth through consultations .
For example , youth were consulted on a Government online initiative that resulted in the “ youth.gc.ca ” website , designed specifically for young Canadians .
I happen to be living proof of how the Government of Canada partners with its youth : I was chosen as a United Nations delegate for this week 's meetings through an online essay writing competition .
There is a strong support for young Canadians to take an active role in policymaking through online and in - person consultations and that support continues to grow .
As we move into the future and as globalization progresses , Canada recognizes the international challenge of addressing the welfare of youth .
And while we address youth issues nationally , international links must not be ignored .
The Canadian International Development Agency supports an array of initiatives to ensure equitable , inclusive and sustainable development , as well as pragmatic improvements in the lives of people around the world , including youth .
The Agency engages Canadians abroad in missions that work to meet the goals of the World Programme of Action for Youth in the area of education .
Canadian international efforts focus on four main areas .
The first is improving the quality , safety and relevance of basic education , so that student enrolment and motivation remain high .
The second area of focus is removing barriers to resolve gender inequality in education and strengthening the programming in girls ' education .
Another focus is providing education on HIV / AIDS prevention and supporting the better integration of such programmes in the curricula .
The fourth element provides education for girls and boys in conflict , post -conflict or emergency situations to introduce stability and protection in emergency settings .
That work allows Canada to contribute to the efforts of countries around the world .
Clearly , much needs to be done to ensure the well - being of the world 's youth .
We will continue to work towards improving the outcomes for youth in Canada and around the world .
We ask for the recognition and involvement of youth ; we ask for tolerance and understanding ; and we ask for implementation .
It is time for action .
We all know what to do .
Now , please let us do it .
Mr. Lim ( Singapore ) : It gives me great pleasure to participate in this meeting of the General Assembly devoted to a discussion of youth issues , and particularly to an evaluation of progress made in implementing the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond .
In the concluding recommendations of his World Youth Report 2005 , the Secretary - General stated that young people should be seen as essential partners for building a society of the future .
He affirmed that Governments should continuously evaluate their youth policies and involve young people in that evaluation , and that including youth in policymaking would increase the commitment of young people to the policies that affect them and create greater opportunities for cooperation and true youth participation .
Those statements are consonant with Singapore 's own recent policies to better engage our youth in shaping our country 's future .
Indeed , at his swearing - in address on 12 August 2004 , our Prime Minister made a similar call to young Singaporeans to step forward to make a difference to themselves , to their fellow citizens and to Singapore .
Youth forms the basis of a country 's future ; their aspirations and endeavours will provide the momentum to propel countries forward .
To better engage our youth , our Ministry of Community Development and Sports underwent a structural and name change in 2004 to become the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports .
Singapore also adopted a youth strategy based on the three elements .
First , we must assist youth to develop a stake in society by creating opportunities for them to positively influence their environment .
Secondly , we should ensure that youth have a say in national affairs by involving them in the process of consultation .
Thirdly , we need to provide youth with the support they need to develop and participate meaningfully in society , through facilitation , mentorship and other assistance mechanisms .
The Singapore Government initiated an intensive six - week youth consultation exercise from August to September 2004 .
More than 2,000 young Singaporeans from both Singapore and overseas were invited to share their aspirations for themselves and for Singapore , and to help shape the Government 's new agenda for youth .
They spoke passionately about their beliefs and shared their ideas readily .
More than 100 young participants later volunteered to follow up on the suggestions raised during the consultation exercise .
They formed working groups , proposed a further 91 recommendations and championed issues that had emerged as key concerns during the consultations .
The working group process enabled the Singapore Government to take one step further , moving beyond public consultation to collaborative action .
Our young people assumed leadership over the process and over some of the ideas that are now being implemented .
Those include a festival , “ Shine ” , organized by young people for young people , that celebrates the talents of our youth ; an Internet portal , “ youth.sg ” , as a first - stop virtual meeting place and resource centre for youth to start their own community projects ; a 1.2 hectare youth community hub designed , developed and operated by youth in the heart of the city for youth cultural and community activities ; and a “ young changemakers ” programme for young Singaporeans to assess and award seed grants to community projects proposed by their peers .
It is also important for our youth to understand and appreciate the realities of the world beyond their immediate communities .
In that regard , the Singapore Government has also undertaken efforts to initiate regional and international youth exchanges to connect Singapore 's youth to the world and to prepare them to be world - ready .
Through such strategic linkups , youth leaders of participating youth organizations have the opportunity to share best practices in areas of youth sector development with their peers overseas .
It is that type of informal and intuitive mutual understanding that will pave the way for closer ties between young people across countries .
Youth is a key resource for society .
If we build on the potential of our youth , communities will develop and grow stronger .
The future awaits us , and it lies in the hands of our young people .
Mr. Abel ( Brazil ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : I should like at the outset to acknowledge the young people of Brazil and my colleagues from the National Youth Secretariat , who are joining in our work via the Internet .
Ten years have passed since the adoption of the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond .
We all have a great deal to celebrate , but there is still a long way to go before we can guarantee future generations the right to enjoy a better world — a world of real opportunity , justice and solidarity .
Brazil has 34 million young people , making up 20 per cent of the population .
It is the young people who suffer most from the harsh reality of social inequality in our country and throughout the world .
Efforts in the context of the World Programme of Action for Youth have come together with actions taken by the Government and the people of Brazil to set out integrated policies to improve the living conditions of our young people .
Brazil declared 2005 to be the National Year for Youth , and I would like to outline some of the actions that have been taken for the benefit of young people .
In February , the Government of Brazil established the National Youth Secretariat , under the auspices of the general secretariat of the presidency of the Republic .
We also established a general counsel for youth — a special forum for intergenerational dialogue and the elaboration of policies aimed at young people .
Furthermore , a national programme for young people , entitled “ Projovem ” , has been launched , with a budget of more than $ 100 million .
The goal of that programme is to make up the significant educational deficit in our country , as well as to prepare young people for the labour market .
By the end of 2005 , more than 200,000 young people will have benefited from that programme .
We are convinced that that initiative , as well as our First Job Programme , will soon bear fruit .
Brazil had the privilege of hosting the Latin American and Caribbean Youth Leadership Summit , organized by the United Nations Development Fund , which brought together young leaders from the region to discuss the Millennium Development Goals from a youth perspective .
Thanks to our national HIV / AIDS policy , which addresses prevention , assistance and treatment and guarantees universal access to antiretroviral medication , without discrimination and with respect for human rights , the rate of infection in the general population is very low .
Furthermore , our schools health and prevention programme provides information on HIV to all students and distributes condoms free of charge .
With regard to girls and young women , policy priorities focus on gender - related violence and the promotion of sexual and reproductive health .
To that end , action is being coordinated among various Government agencies and civil society .
The Brazilian Government is firmly committed to combating hunger and poverty .
In that context , Brazil reaffirms the commitment that it made in 2004 as one of the leading countries of the Youth Employment Network .
We commend the Secretary - General for his initiative aimed at enabling young people to get a foothold in the labour market , there by contributing to the reduction of social inequalities .
Brazil is carrying out activities in all areas of the World Programme of Action for Youth .
The dialogue between the Government and civil society is extremely important in that process .
We are convinced that public policies for youth are among the most important means of achieving comprehensive development , not only in our country , but also throughout the world .
Mr. Bhattarai ( Nepal ) : We are meeting here today to evaluate the progress made in the implementation of the 15 priority areas in the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond .
Five years ago , our leaders promised the people of the United Nations that they would improve their quality of life through the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) .
The establishment of the United Nations Youth Fund and the launching of the Youth Employment Network encouraged the promotion of national action plans for youth employment .
The outcome document contains commitments to the goals of full and productive employment and decent work for all , including for women and young people .
Those documents provide a road map for social and economic development — an explicit commitment to tackle inequalities in income , opportunity and power , to promote social integration and to address the issue of the social protection and welfare of children , youth , the elderly and disabled persons .
Young people represent the future .
Youth is a time both of opportunity and of challenge .
Thanks to several development forums , the case for investing in young people has been made clearer , and today youth has come to occupy the centre stage of international development .
An investment in youth is an investment in the future .
In order to harness the potential of youth , and thereby enrich society , we must give young people — particularly those from marginalized and disadvantaged communities — a say and a share at the grass - roots level in the development process , ensuring that they play a full role in shaping a bright and secure future for all of us .
A committed and aware young person is an asset to the community and the country .
The fact that some countries are poor while others are prosperous poses a great threat to international peace and security .
Poverty is a curse and a scar for any society .
People living in poverty are vulnerable and voiceless .
Traffickers and terrorists recruit them by offering tempting rewards .
People without income or security fall prey to crime and violence , and often get trapped in protracted conflict .
The economic and social costs become pervasive .
We must address the severe inequalities and inequities , and put in place programmes to provide employment opportunities and ensure institutional and policy development , as well as civil society initiatives for the education and health of children .
Youth empowerment is necessary in order to combat the vulnerability of young people to the influence of fundamentalism , radicalism , insurgency and terrorism .
Nepal has been the victim of senseless violence perpetrated by terrorists , which has taken a great toll in terms of lives , and has had an adverse impact on young people and prevented them from engaging in constructive processes .
Nepal 's current development plan includes a policy reform package , which addresses , among other issues , social inclusion , empowerment , gender mainstreaming , education and health for all , income - generating activities , the prohibition of socio - cultural discriminatory practices , targeted and time - bound development programmes and participatory governance .
Our utmost priority at the moment is to restore peace and order , put development efforts back on track and provide opportunities for all to realize their potential .
Nepal looks forward to working with the international community to engage young people , develop their capacity , tap their knowledge and skills and promote and support their participation in economic and social life through an integrated package of measures .
In this increasingly interconnected and interdependent world , creating a sustained global partnership with young people is a must for any programme to succeed .
Development policies should therefore be supportive of growth , poverty reduction and the creation of decent work for all .
For this to happen , there must be urgent action on various international commitments and sustained global partnership for providing resources , trade opportunities and debt relief measures to least developed countries , taking into account their special needs and vulnerability .
It is equally important to have the multidimensional strategy to fight the closely linked problems of poverty and terrorism at the national , regional and global levels without any selective standards .
Let us join hands to channel the power of youth into a precious resource for development .
Mr. Le Luong Minh ( Viet Nam ) : My delegation welcomes the convening of this plenary meeting of the General Assembly devoted to the evaluation of the progress made in the implementation of the World Programme for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond .
The round table held yesterday as a forum for the expression and exchange of youth perspectives was a meaningful and useful event .
We were pleased to see a young delegate from Viet Nam participating in yesterday 's round table as a presenter for the Asia-Pacific region .
Of the 80 million people of Viet Nam , 16 million are young people between the ages of 15 and 24 ; that is nearly 20 per cent of the country 's population .
Viewing young people as the country 's future , the Government of Viet Nam attaches great importance to addressing youth issues , including the 10 priority areas of the World Programme of Action , which are interdependent and interlinked .
In this statement I will touch upon three of them .
First , as regards youth and employment , in our National Youth Development Strategy to the Year 2010 , which was approved by the Government in 2003 , unemployment was identified as the biggest difficulty currently facing our young people .
Many efforts , including policies , programmes and concrete measures , have been undertaken to address this problem .
Vulnerable groups among young people , such as first - time job seekers , unskilled workers and young women , receive special attention in various job orientation and training activities .
The Government 's pro-poor policies and programmes provide for easier access to microcredits by young people , especially those living in poorer areas , so that they can start their own businesses .
The Viet Nam Association of Young Entrepreneurs provides assistance to young people in starting up and running their businesses .
As nearly 1.4 million young job seekers enter the labour market annually , our Government has set a target of creating 1.5 million new jobs each year .
The second area is youth and education .
In order to secure a better chance at finding full and productive employment , it is imperative that young people receive adequate education and training .
To this end , achieving Millennium Development Goal ( MDG ) 2 , universal primary education , is a must .
During the 2003 - 2004 school year , the net primary enrolment rate was 94.4 per cent , while the completion rate rose to 99.82 per cent .
If the current annual growth rate of 0.5 per cent is maintained , we will achieve universal primary education by 2015 .
We have set a range of targets as contained in the Development Strategy for Training and Education for 2001 - 2010 , the National Action Plan of Education for All for 2003 - 2015 , the National Targeted Programme on Education and Training for 2001 - 2010 and the five - year and annual socio - economic development plans .
Public resources allocated to education and training have constantly increased .
The third area is youth and poverty .
The focus on employment and education , among other areas of priority , is a central part of our poverty reduction strategy .
Although the proportion of young people in poverty is lower than the national average in Viet Nam — 18 per cent compared to 24 per cent — we attach great importance to poverty reduction for young people .
Our national targets include a 50 per cent reduction in the number of people living below the poverty line during the period 2001 - 2010 .
To achieve this , special attention is given to rural and remote areas and to minority groups .
The first survey assessment of Vietnamese youth was launched in August of this year .
The survey noted in its chapter 1 that “ The majority of Vietnamese young people are hardworking , strongly connected to their families , optimistic about the future and generally satisfied with their employment situation ” .
It has also been observed that Viet Nam , with its high rates of literacy and numeracy , long experience with mass organizations and ability to mobilize people down to the village level , has sufficient absorptive capacity to continue moving forward in developing programmes and strategies for reducing poverty .
At this plenary meeting we are evaluating our individual national implementation of the World Programme of Action .
There is an important aspect of this process of implementing the Programme that also needs to be emphasized : cooperation and assistance among countries and among young people from different countries in terms of experience - sharing , technical and financial assistance , training , et cetera .
Such cooperation and assistance should and can be carried out at both regional and international levels .
In conclusion , young people are not only the beneficiaries of the aforementioned policies , programmes and targets .
They are also the driving force in implementing those policies , programmes and targets .
Investing in our youth means , as always , investing in our future .
Ms. Damsgaard - Larsen ( Denmark ) : As a youth delegate in the Danish delegation to the sixtieth session of the General Assembly , and as a representative of the Danish Youth Council , it is a great honour and a privilege for me to address the Assembly .
It is a great privilege because , in general , young people — and in particular young women — have a hard time getting their voices heard .
Too often , decision - makers base their decisions on experiences that are not shared by all young people , and therefore the decisions do not always take into consideration our increasingly globalized world .
Too often , young people are not included in decisions that impact on their lives at both the national and the international levels .
Those decisions could be improved or made more sustainable by including the perspectives of young people .
Too often , young people are perceived to be associated with problems instead of solutions .
In order to be solved , those problems need the involvement of young people .
Please , have confidence in young people .
It is true that young people are indeed overrepresented in statistics related to negative issues .
I would like to comment on two of those issues , HIV and terrorism .
Half the world 's HIV victims are infected before they turn 25 , and disgruntled young men and women are in the frontline of terrorism and armed conflict .
If we want to meet those and other major challenges , we must involve young people .
Nothing will be achieved for young people without the participation of young people .
When it comes to the battle against AIDS , it is absolutely pivotal to encourage young people to follow the ABC strategy : abstain , be faithful or use condoms .
As noted with respect to the Millennium Development Goals , only by sharply reducing the rate of HIV - prevalence among young people will we be able to stop the pandemic .
With respect to counter - terrorism measures , they should not be just about weapons .
Equally important is shielding young people from totalitarian ideas by providing them with positive experiences of democracy and cultural tolerance .
We will not be able to achieve the Millennium Development Goals or our shared vision of a more peaceful planet unless young people are genuinely recognized and utilized as a resource in society .
We can do much more nationally , as well as internationally , to involve young people in solving major problems in our global community .
First , it is important to compile detailed statistics and data on problems concerning young people .
In that respect , the World Bank deserves credit for making young people the theme of its World Development Report 2007 and for consulting young people about which problems to include in the Report .
The Bank has set an example .
Secondly , obligations already agreed should be met .
The ideas set out in the World Programme of Action for Youth have yet to be fulfilled .
Ten years after the Programme 's adoption , a lot still needs to be done , and too many Member States have not given the Programme the attention it deserves .
Thirdly , we lack a comprehensive strategy for involving young people in the struggle to achieve the Millennium Development Goals .
Investing in young people is a prudent choice .
There is a strong link between investing in young people and fulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals .
And finally , there needs to be a stronger focus on young people 's global awareness and their understanding of global issues .
More education on global issues is needed to combat intolerance and promote international solidarity .
We ask for the recognition and the involvement of youth .
We ask for tolerance and understanding , and we ask for implementation .
Numerous agreements have been signed to make poverty past history , provide education for all , promote the rights of the child and so on — agreements with great visions and ideas for a better world , agreements that call for action .
We need to make an extraordinary effort , if the visions expressed in agreements already signed are to become a reality .
Increasing the involvement of young people will fuel much - needed implementation .
It is quite interesting to note that the abbreviation of the World Programme of Action for Youth is “ WPAY ” , which in English is pronounced “ we pay ” , because I am certain that young people are willing to contribute .
But if young people are to be encouraged to do so , they need to be involved in the decisions that define the solutions they will have to pay for .
It is time for action .
We all know what to do .
Now , please let us do it .
Mr. Kariyawasam ( Sri Lanka ) : The World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond , adopted by the General Assembly in 1995 in resolution 50 / 81 , gives us guidance for the formulation of our vision and policies for youth .
It contains significant benchmarks and targets to be realized to make youth a central focus of national and international development agendas .
The vision for youth beyond 2000 that the World Programme of Action has fostered is designed to facilitate coherent and coordinated actions at multiple levels of Government and the international community .
Its emphasis on the adoption of a multi-stakeholder approach , making youth key players , seeks to give youth a significant , participatory role and voice in national and local - level decision - making processes .
Today , 10 years after the Programme 's adoption , we are meeting to review the situation of youth and the achievements made in implementing the World Programme of Action .
In doing so , however , we must not ignore the factors that dominate the global issues of today but which were not discernible at the time of the Programme 's adoption .
Since that time , the world has changed in many ways that no one envisaged , and new obstacles and challenges have arisen as a result .
Considerable obstacles remain on achieving decent standards of social development .
A notable constraint is the increased strain on precious resources , which are increasingly being diverted to meet new and emerging threats to peace , security , democracy and the rule of law .
Other negative developments include the growing loss of domestic policy leverage as a result of globalization , the falling volume of the international trade of middle - income and less developed countries , increasing oil prices , the widening digital divide and the globalization of terror .
All those factors continue to severely affect many developing countries , especially middle - income and less developed countries .
As a result , those countries have a severely limited ability to mobilize domestic resources , meaning that less attention can be given to vital sectors .
The continued reduction in the quality of foreign aid , coupled with the growing strain on domestic resources , has only deepened the perception of inequality and inequity within societies .
That stark , ongoing reality affects young people , who are so vital for the continued development of our societies .
Another contemporary phenomenon affecting youth in developing countries such as mine is large - scale migration abroad , as young people look for work and better living conditions .
While that phenomenon helps both the receiving and sending countries , it has also created new challenges .
In that regard , we are heartened that the outcome document of the recently concluded summit has referred to the issue of migration and that the next session of the General Assembly will discuss the issue of migration and development .
Since the phenomenon of migration primarily affects youth and their aspirations , it is essential that all United Nations agencies make every effort to mainstream the issue of migration in all its aspects .
I shall now say a few words about the progress made in implementing the World Programme of Action for Youth in Sri Lanka .
In Sri Lanka the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports has taken several steps to promote youth activities .
Those include the promotion of youth clubs , the establishment of technical and vocational training centres and the organization of cultural exchanges and integration activities .
Training activities are conducted in various fields to improve the skills and abilities of young people who leave school and guide them towards decent employment .
Sports and recreation facilities contribute to nurturing a healthy generation of youth and create opportunities for the better utilization of time .
As a country with good social indicators , Sri Lanka has always given high priority to programmes related to youth and has taken into account the views and concerns of young people in formulating national policies and strategies , especially with respect to education and employment .
The national action plans of Sri Lanka have focused on enhancing the quality of education and on providing equal opportunities for employment .
Youth participation in sub-national and national decision - making processes has always been encouraged as a matter of national policy .
For many years throughout our 2,500 - year recorded history , and especially since the provision of universal franchise for our people in 1931 , we have been mindful that it is young people that make or break a society .
Hence , we are committed to the welfare of youth in order to ensure the well - being of our society .
Mr. Peretin ( Croatia ) : My name is Matej Peretin , and I am a youth delegate and a member of the Croatian delegation to the sixtieth session of the General Assembly .
I am 14 years old and a first - year student at the Petar Preradović grammar school in Slatina , a town in northern Croatia .
I was recently elected President of the Local Youth Council of Slatina , which operates within the framework of the Croatian National Youth Council .
Croatia has aligned itself with the statement of the European Union delivered by the United Kingdom .
I wish to take this opportunity to describe how young people in Croatia have implemented , at the local level , the recommendations of the World Programme of Action for Youth and the relevant parts of the Millennium Goals .
Croatia has had a national youth policy since 2000 .
Among the key priorities of this policy are the participation of youth in decision - making , non-formal education and youth employment .
Consistent with the call of the World Programme of Action for Youth for full and effective participation of youth in the life of society and in decision - making , a National Youth Council was initiated and registered in Croatia in 2001 .
The Council operates as a national civil society organization , open to all young people in Croatia between the ages of 15 and 29 .
The Croatian National Youth Council has signed a social partnership agreement with the Croatian Government , and the Government has approved the Council as a member of the State working group for the elaboration of a national programme of action for youth .
In 2001 , the President of the Council was invited to participate in the Croatian President 's expert group for youth .
The Council has also represented the interests of Croatian youth at a number of international events , including , inter alia , the fourth session of the World Youth Forum , held in Dakar ; the International Labour Organization Global Employment Forum ; and the World Summit on the Information Society , held in Geneva .
In 2005 , the Council was awarded the World Youth Award by the World Assembly of Youth as one of the three most effective national youth councils globally .
The Secretary - General of the Croatian National Youth Council serves as the Vice - President of the World Assembly of Youth .
The network of local youth councils in Croatia relies significantly upon information and communications technology .
I invite delegates to visit the Croatian National Youth Council booth near Conference Room 4 here at United Nations Headquarters to learn more about the Council 's governance and activities .
The Croatian delegation invites youth delegates and Governments of Member States to re-commit themselves to the implementation of the World Programme of Action for Youth .
In this regard , we encourage Member States that have not yet done so to consider adopting a full and effective youth participation agenda at all levels of Government in relation to the social , economic and political processes that concern young people .
In Croatia , we have found that direct elections for local youth councils have been important in strengthening legitimacy .
In addition , cooperation between local civil society organizations , governmental bodies and the private sector can be helpful in developing funding schemes for employment and educational opportunities for youth .
Finally , allow me to draw the Assembly 's attention to a Croatian initiative .
In 2002 , we began negotiations on the establishment of a Croatian Youth Bank , focused on job creation for young people .
In the same year , youth representatives from around the world gathered in Croatia and expressed their will to be included in the process of establishing a world youth bank .
In 2002 , a special resolution on a world youth bank was adopted by most representatives of national youth councils across the globe .
The World Youth Bank Network , an international non-governmental organization that is the preparatory body for the establishment of a world youth bank , is now operating from its administrative headquarters in Zagreb .
It is my pleasure to invite all participants to join us tomorrow at the World Youth Bank Project side event , which will focus on a potential strategy to address the global problem of the high level of youth unemployment .
Members can also learn more about this project on the World Wide Web at www.w-yb.org.
Finally , allow me to express the intention of the Government of the Republic of Croatia to continue to attach special importance to the implementation of the World Programme of Action for Youth .
Ms. Hennouda ( Algeria ) ( spoke in French ) : It is an honour for me to represent my country at this youth forum .
We particularly welcome the presence of young people at the United Nations today , as well as the aspirations they are expressing .
The reports we are hearing today as we consider the implementation of the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond , adopted 10 years ago , give us a glimpse of the development of youth and assess the Programme 's 10 priority areas so that we can fill the gaps .
We note with satisfaction the increased awareness by States of the importance of young people 's potential and of involving them in the decision - making process .
We also welcome national efforts to ensure gender equality , and we encourage States to continue making progress on education and literacy .
However , continuing youth unemployment , the consequences of drug use and HIV / AIDS arouse our anxiety and concern , since they threaten the lives and environment of our young people .
The World Youth Report 2005 ( A/60/61 ) draws our attention , in particular , to the impact of globalization and of the information and communications technology , which are described as additional issues of concern which youth and their leaders must face .
Certainly , globalization continues to give rise to ambivalent feelings , on the one hand because of its ability to create wealth and improve the material well - being of our societies , but , on the other , because of the phenomenon of exclusion that it creates . How can we diminish this exclusion ? How can we move towards overall prosperity ?
How can we benefit from globalization , create jobs for young people and eradicate poverty ? How can we ensure that information and telecommunications technology becomes a means for rapprochement , mutual understanding and the strengthening of links among young people throughout the world ?
Today , we must find solutions to those questions in order to attain the goals we set at the time of the adoption of the World Programme of Action for Youth . Our Governments have the tasks of understanding globalization in order to better harness it , generating innovative ideas for job creation , steering young people away from drugs and protecting them from HIV / AIDS .
To succeed , Governments must deal with those challenges together with young people by directly involving them in the identification of their problems and the search for solutions .
Algeria attaches great importance to young people , who constitute three quarters of the country 's population .
The country 's public authorities , conscious of that reality , are making significant efforts to integrate that force for development into society , regardless of gender .
The Government has made a strategic and productive investment in education .
All categories of public education institutions are free at all levels .
Public education is mandatory and provided for all , and we have achieved a 93.6 per cent rate of school attendance among young people .
The Government has dealt with the issue of youth not enrolled in school through special measures to ensure their social and professional integration .
The national employment policy , which occupies an important place in overall Government policy , is supported by a national strategy aimed at fighting poverty and exclusion .
The Government of my country has implemented alternative employment measures essentially managed by a network of agencies specialized in promoting youth employment .
The unemployment rate has been reduced thanks to innovative measures such as microcredits , the promotion of entrepreneurship , labour - intensive work of public utility , pre-employment contracts , local salaried employee initiatives and compensation for activities of general benefit .
Many young people have been able to acquire professional experience and practical knowledge making them employable .
Determined to pursue its efforts and respond to the expectations of young people , Algeria has just carried out a study on their aspirations , resulting in a database on young people — girls and boys — of all professional categories , ages and education levels , with respect to their needs and aspirations in the numerous areas of their life such as their relationships with family , school and teachers , the street , youth establishments , health , languages , the role of women , sports , leisure activities , information and communication technologies , politics and the future .
That study has shown that , while progress has been made in various areas of concern to young people , domestic and international challenges , which are now interlinked , remain to be tackled .
In response to globalization , the information society and communication technologies , at the domestic level we must promote leisure activities for young people as a means of social integration , provide quality education , ensure the highest level of professional qualifications among youth , create an environment favourable to our intellectual elite so as to halt their emigration , and ensure sustainable employment .
To achieve those goals , my country will once again consult young people to collect their opinions on the proposed solutions .
We are convinced that the recommendations contained in the reports of the Secretary - General will provide relevant guidelines for our country 's success in its mission .
The Acting President : I should like to inform the Assembly that the representatives of Lesotho and Nicaragua have requested to participate in this meeting .
As the list of speakers was closed at 11 a.m. this morning , may I ask the Assembly whether there is any objection to the inclusion of those delegations in the list of speakers ?
I see none .
Lesotho and Nicaragua are therefore included in the list of speakers .
I remind speakers that we now have 16 speakers on our list for this meeting .
Given the time limit and in order to accommodate all speakers for this meeting , I urge speakers to limit their statements to four minutes .
Ms. Mchiela ( Malawi ) : Let me begin by aligning my delegation with the statement made by Mozambique on behalf of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) .
I would also like to congratulate the Secretary - General for his comprehensive report contained in document A /60 /61 .
The World Youth Report 2005 states that sub -Saharan Africa is home to large numbers of young people living in extreme poverty .
It has been proven that when the health , education and employment needs of the youth are addressed in earnest , the result is poverty reduction , economic growth and human development .
The international community has the moral obligation to match its youth - related programmes with the requisite resources .
Malawi attaches great importance to youth participation .
We believe that the involvement of youth in decisions that affect society is beneficial from both a policy - making and a youth development perspective .
We have learned over time that failure to acknowledge the particular challenges that youth face or to involve them in devising solutions leads to failure in reducing overall poverty levels .
In recognition of that fact , the poverty reduction and economic growth strategies put in place by the Malawian Government have incorporated youth programmes .
Malawi has a national youth policy that guides youth development programmes and services with the full participation of young people at all levels .
That has led to a mushrooming of youth clubs and non-governmental organizations .
Through its national AIDS commission , Malawi continues to implement programmes focusing on support , treatment and care for those infected and affected by HIV / AIDS .
In addition , the national plan of action for orphans and other vulnerable children was launched to deal with the unprecedented number of orphans and strengthen the capacity of families and communities to provide adequate care and support for those affected .
A life - skills programme targeting youth is an important component of the action plan .
Convinced that empowering youth through education will enable them to have equal access to participation in the national development agenda , Malawi implemented universal free primary education under the national Education for All programme .
Through that programme , the enrolment of pupils in primary schools increased tremendously .
However , access to secondary and tertiary education remains a serious challenge for all children , particularly orphans and youth from poor families , owing to the lack of funds for school fees and other educational support .
One initiative in that respect is the provision of student grants .
Nevertheless , the number of beneficiaries is far inferior to the demand coming from of needy youth .
Mr. Gaspar Martins ( Angola ) , Vice - President , took the Chair .
Malawi has implemented several initiatives to protect youth at risk of being abused .
They include vocational skills training for self - help , training in entrepreneurship , the review of laws on child justice , care and protection and the training of social workers .
Further , the Government has introduced measures such as the creation of a revolving fund for loans to youth to give young people access to financial capital to a set up small businesses .
Leisure activities are an important aspect of youth development .
Malawi continues to establish youth centres in urban and rural areas .
The aim of those centres is to engage youth in extra-curricular activities for their physical growth and mental development .
In conclusion , Malawi is committed to keeping youth issues high on its development agenda .
I would also like to stress the critical importance of international cooperation if developing countries such as Malawi are to fulfil the Millennium Development Goals and the priority areas of the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond .
Mr. García González ( El Salvador ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : El Salvador fully endorses the statement of the Rio Group on this item .
The Government of El Salvador was committed to sending a high - level representative to this meeting to review the 10 years of the World Programme of Action for Youth : the Secretary of Youth , who holds a national office created in 2004 with the fundamental objective of ensuring the active participation of young people in decisions of national interest and on issues that directly affect youth .
However , two natural disasters of great destructive power — the eruption of the Ilamatepec volcano and the flooding caused by Tropical Storm Stan — have caused the death of 62 Salvadorans and the evacuation of 53,930 others throughout the country over the last three days , compelling our Government to declare a state of national emergency and to suspend official engagements scheduled for the present so that Government officials can attend first and foremost to the emergency .
Given the negative impact of those natural disasters on the sustainable development of our country , and given the vulnerability of young people , among other social groups , to natural disasters , we believe that we should focus our statement on the intrinsic links between hunger , poverty , the environment and situations of risk for young people , in particular the violence caused by the activities of youth gangs .
Those issues fall within the three main clusters of issues proposed by the Secretary - General in his World Youth Report 2005 ( A/60/61 ) .
As President Elías Antonio Saca González noted in his address to the Assembly at the sixtieth session ( see A/60 / PV.12 ) , in spite of our country 's determined commitment to achieve the Millennium Development Goals , in particular the reduction of poverty and the fight against hunger , the negative impact on development caused by external factors such as costly fuel and natural disasters of the kind striking our country in recent weeks is cause for concern .
My country notes that those factors require a significant share of our human and financial resources , compelling us to redirect to those emergencies resources that could have been used in strategic areas of development .
Thus , there is a clear link between the fight against poverty and hunger on the one hand and , on the other , the protection of the environment and the reduction of vulnerabilities related to outstanding development issues .
Young people constitute the largest segment of the population of El Salvador .
Thus , the policies and actions currently being implemented to tackle development challenges directly affect young people .
El Salvador responded by appointing a Secretary of Youth , whose department is working , with broad participation , on a national youth policy .
That policy covers various objectives related to young people , such as improving their quality of life and their development at all levels and attending to the needs of vulnerable and marginalized sectors of youth .
To achieve those objectives , concrete action is being taken in five main areas : promoting the independence of young people , promoting their well - being , developing awareness of their civic responsibilities , supporting the development of the creativity of youth and creating opportunities for vulnerable and marginalized youth .
As well , it is necessary to coordinate the various efforts and initiatives of the Office of the Secretary of Youth , public institutions and non-governmental and private - sector organizations involved in the promotion of youth issues , as well as those of youth organizations and movements , which are a focus and the beneficiaries of that national policy .
It is important to stress that the Government of El Salvador considers that young people represent not only the future hope of the country but also a source of great potential for the present .
A sign of that commitment was the appointment of the Secretary of Youth , whose main tasks include the promotion of sport as a way to turn youth , and the general population , away from vice and idleness .
Allow me to conclude by recognizing the fact that in a globalized world , in which information technologies play an important role in highlighting areas of common interest for young people , it is increasingly clear that international cooperation , respect for the purposes and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and solidarity constitute the cornerstone for constructive progress in creating a society for all ages .
Ms. Taj El Dine ( Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : On behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela , we express our gratitude for the holding of these meetings .
We endorse the statement made by the representative of Argentina on behalf of the Rio Group .
First , we note that with everything that has been done over the past 10 years , the only result we have achieved is that the world 's young people continue to suffer from hunger , poverty , unemployment and a lack of education , all of which are products of the dominant economic system .
In other words , they are the result of the policies of the United States of America and its allies , which implement policies against the interests of the entire world , with the single objective of increasing exploitation and legitimizing and safeguarding its domination of the world 's markets , resources and peoples .
By contrast , the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has implemented a set of social measures within the framework of a holistic State social policy to promote economic and social development from a humanist perspective .
In that context , our Government has been implementing a series of social programmes , called missions , aimed at integrating young people , in particular marginalized young people , into the social development of the country .
Among them are the Robinson , Ribas and Sucre missions .
The Robinson mission has succeeded in teaching more than 1.5 million people to read and write .
In a few days , our country will be declared an illiteracy - free zone .
More than 600,000 young people have graduated thanks to the Ribas mission .
For economic reasons , those young people had never had the opportunity to pursue their secondary education , and have now done so without cost .
Our Government even gives them a grant to carry out their studies .
The Sucre mission is open to young people from the Ribas mission and to marginalized young people so that they can enter university .
In addition , young people in Venezuela are involved in the political life of the State .
For example , citizens having reached the age of 21 can run for office as members of the National Assembly .
All those initiatives aim to fulfil the constitutional principle of a genuinely participatory and activist democracy , of the people , for the people and with the people .
In our countries , young people have a notable role in the fight against imperialism .
In Venezuela , we are aware of the fact that young people of the entire world have been affected by the consequences of the neo-liberal policies of the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank , the World Trade Organization and the Group of Eight .
The gap between the rich and the poor is widening .
Exploitation , hunger , unemployment , inadequate health care , poverty and destitution continue to grow as a result of imperialist economic and military policies that have catastrophic effects for millions of people throughout the world , including youth .
Our message is that we , the young , must fight against hunger and war and fight for peace , social justice , the self - determination of peoples and a world free of nuclear weapons .
We must fight for our roots .
We must fight for our traditions and cultures — in short , for our dignity .
That is our foremost duty as young people .
We must ensure that the world recognizes the value of those aspirations .
It is also our duty to ensure that humankind survives the destruction that threatens our environment .
I recall once more the words of President Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías : neither our arms nor our souls shall rest until humankind has been saved .
Mr. Gómez Robledo ( Mexico ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : It is a great honour for Mexico to participate in this meeting to assess progress in the implementation of the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond , which has seen the significant participation of young people from around the world .
It would difficult to imagine implementing the World Programme of Action or achieving the Millennium Development Goals without the participation of young people .
These meetings have shown that .
Mexico associates itself with the statement made by the delegation of Argentina on behalf of the Rio Group .
We shall take this opportunity to share some of our experiences with implementation of the World Programme of Action .
Following the Programme 's adoption , the bodies responsible for formulating and implementing Mexico 's youth policies underwent a profound change .
The Government formulated a youth strategy based on a recognition of the importance of the needs of youth , in particular economic issues , social inclusion , equity and respect for the diversity of youth , and affirming the principle of the full participation of youth in decision - making .
In accordance with that vision , the Mexican Youth Institute was created as a governmental body charged with designing and implementing a national policy for the full integration of youth in the country 's development .
With the Institute 's coordination , the first national youth programme was established , its is a combined effort among young people , society and the Government .
The national youth programme has three key goals : to promote the enhancement of the quality of life and well - being of young people , to generate areas of opportunity for the development of collective and individual abilities and to create equitable conditions for marginalized youth .
The participation of young people is a component of the national youth programme , because of their capacity for action and because such participation is needed for an effective assessment of their situation , as they are actors in national development .
Recognizing the importance of their participation , the programme also aims to create conditions in which young people can engage in development activities , taking into consideration the country 's varied conditions and pluralism .
The Mexican Youth Institute 's various programmes seek to fully integrate young people into public life .
Through dialogue mechanisms with a variety of sectors , the Institute promotes conditions for young people 's access to opportunities for comprehensive development , the enhancement of quality of life and more complete participation in areas related to their aspirations and demands .
In that way , the programmes have helped develop the participation of young people in civic life and promote a positive vision of youth , which , in turn , enables them to achieve better social integration .
Through that formula of dialogue and participation , the youth of Mexico have been made aware that Government stands by their side .
The Government of the Republic consults them on the formulation of policies of concern to youth , such as those related to the implementation of the World Programme of Action .
Our legislature recently held a first Model United Nations in the Congress .
It brought together young people from all over the country and provided a valuable forum for understanding their concerns on important issues .
That effort is also reflected in the inclusion today , for the first time , of two young people in the delegation of Mexico for this session of the General Assembly , which is a source of great satisfaction .
Let us hope that this is only the beginning of an ongoing practice .
The new generation of Mexican youth is aware of the varied and multicultural nature of Mexican society .
The Government is committed to implementing the World Programme of Action .
Our progress in the 10 priority areas of the Programme has been shared with other countries of our region and was presented as a contribution to the report of the Secretary - General ( A/60/61 ) .
We support the inclusion of the five additional priority areas set out in draft resolution A / 60 / L.2 .
We are committed to continue taking the relevant measures to assess the situation of youth with respect to those areas and taking the corresponding action .
Mr. Samkharadze ( Georgia ) : First , I would like to express my gratitude to the United Nations , the world 's most important organization , and to Secretary - General Kofi Annan for giving young people of many countries the opportunity to speak before the Assembly on youth problems and how to solve them .
The Anti-drug Society , of which I am President , is a non-governmental organization in Georgia that has been fighting drugs since 1999 .
Student organizations from various institutions of higher education have joined our young anti-narcotics coalition .
Working jointly , we are trying to crack down on the problem by arranging seminars , exhibitions and sports events .
I would like to draw the attention of the Assembly to several issues of concern to the peoples of the world , especially young people .
Today we are witnessing a critical trend : the number of young drug addicts is increasing rapidly .
This is becoming a global problem with terrible consequences , because most drug addicts become socially unstable and often turn to crime .
Unfortunately , such young people are not willing , nor do they have ability , to become full members of society or to be useful to it .
We can even say that they are being lost as individuals and lost as citizens .
Narcotics and terrorism are interrelated , because narcotics are the main source of financing for terrorism .
Also important is the harm done to economies , as countries are incurring losses of billions of dollars .
Unfortunately , drug addicts often do not know that the money they pay for another dose of narcotics helps terrorists buy ultra-modern weapons and ammunition .
In my opinion , this important aspect of the question merits particular attention .
That money helps many terrorist organizations worldwide and enables terrorists to commit terrible acts almost every day , the world over .
We young people must see that our peers think about this .
The ecological damage that the world is facing is no less important .
Hundreds of thousands of acres of forests are cut down to produce drugs .
Various chemicals and other dangerous substances from illegal laboratories are polluting lakes , rivers and seas and are harming both flora and fauna .
Another factor is psychological damage .
Of course , this is by no means a complete list , but each of those issues includes elements with the potential for causing a major disaster .
I think that this is an inarguable fact .
Political , economic , psychological and social sciences have given us a broad range of knowledge over the ages .
It is important to organize the information into a kind of system and to analyse it properly .
Only in that way will we be able to understand the facts .
The twenty - first century is a time of integrated thinking .
I should like to take this unique opportunity to recall the events of 11 September 2001 .
I still can not find a suitable definition for that destructive event , and I think I never will .
One thing is obvious : an evil was done that can not be undone .
In my opinion , the attack of 11 September was not just an attack on a particular building , country or people .
It was an attack on the idea of democracy itself .
I want to address the youth of the world and ask them to unite in a resolute fight against drug addiction .
We must not feed the monster which threatens us with destruction .
We must explain the unpleasant truth to our peers : that with the money paid for each dose of drugs , which adds up to hundreds of billions of dollars throughout the world , terrorists do not build shelters for homeless children , hospitals or houses of worship ; they use that money for their sick , vandalistic aims .
I am asking the Assembly to unite in the fight against drug addiction .
We do not want the future to be in the hands of unstable individuals , which would be a catastrophe and jeopardize the stability and the democratic development of humankind .
Ms. Amati ( San Marino ) : “ Youth is our future ” .
I decided to begin my brief statement with this motto because I believe that these four words sum up what the Republic of San Marino , together with the United Nations , believes .
The world we live in has changed completely in recent decades , as we have achieved the important goal of globalization .
My generation is particularly fortunate , because we have a chance to relate to other young people from all over the world .
We can share our culture with them , and at the same time we get to learn about theirs .
I am very glad to have the chance to attend today 's plenary meeting , dedicated to us , the youth of the world .
The United Nations is the arena where we can best discuss our future .
Secretary - General Kofi Annan has stated that education is a human right .
We could not agree more .
The importance of education is multifaceted ; it is the foundation of a more advanced and developed society .
One of most important actions we can take in favour of young people and of the advancement of our societies is to give our young people a good , sound education which will serve them well in future .
The Republic of San Marino believes that education must have first place on our scale of priorities .
In order to provide a good education to young citizens , our Government not only invests economic resources in education but provides honour students with financial aid .
Education is based on both study and culture .
Culture is what one gets from one 's family , what one learns in one 's country and from one 's country ; basically , it is one 's history ; everyone has his or her own .
In our culture , in San Marino , the family plays a key role in forming new generations .
The relationship between young family members and their elders is very strong and allows young people to learn , from childhood on , valuable lessons about aspects of their background — lessons that will help them in future .
That is why I would like to encourage everyone present today to re-evaluate the needs of young people and to consider what their elders can give to them .
The Acting President : Brief , to the point and beautiful , like San Marino .
Mr. Rustom ( Syrian Arab Republic ) : I should like to shed some light on the status of Syrian young people and on the challenges facing them in the third millennium .
Syria has a very young population ; young people aged 15 to 25 constitute about 25 per cent of the total population .
Moreover , the relatively high population growth rate — 24.5 births per 1,000 — is leading to an increase in the number of young people as a percentage of the total population .
Furthermore , the number of students has increased , leading to higher public expenditures in the area of education , from 7.6 per cent in 1983 to 15 per cent in 2002 .
This large number of young people is a great asset to the nation , but it also creates a number of challenges , which the Government has worked hard to face .
The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic has consistently focused on education .
It has ensured education for all by making it compulsory and free . Educational curricula are revised and modified regularly .
For instance , counselling has been included in the educational curriculum since 2001 , as well as foreign languages and information technology .
In order to eradicate the stereotyped image of women , curricula were modified to include new concepts , such as gender equality .
In addition , Syria has provided the necessary infrastructure to expand Internet service country - wide in order to encourage distance learning .
In the field of information technology ( IT ) and communications , Syria has developed a strategy for the relevant technologies .
In that connection , many mechanisms have been put in place , such as the Syrian Higher Education and Research Network and , in 2002 , the Virtual Learning University .
Moreover , in 2004 , ReefNet was launched in three villages through cooperation between the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the United Nations Development Programme .
The Ministry of Health , in cooperation with the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , launched the Adolescent Health Programme in 2002 , which targets the 10- 19 age group , about 4.5 million inhabitants .
The Programme aims to promote adolescent health standards through health education on health - related issues in general , and on reproductive health in particular .
As for youth and HIV / AIDS , the Ministry of Health has adopted the National Programme for AIDS Control , which puts in place measures to prevent HIV infection and sexually transmitted diseases .
Statistics reveal that the number of patients with HIV / AIDS reached 272 in 2002 .
Drug abuse is not widespread among Syrian young people .
The rate of addiction among the total population is 127 per million , and the incidence among young people under the age of 18 is even smaller .
That is due to many factors — religious , social , familial and moral .
With regard to tobacco control , Syria ratified the World Health Organization 's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2003 .
The average number of cigarettes smoked by young people in Syria is about 3 per day .
Syria recently became a State party to the Youth Employment Network .
The Syrian strategy on the employment of youth is going to be managed and implemented at all stages through community interaction , including partners from all sectors — the public , private and civil society .
That strategy , which targets young people aged 18 to 25 , aims to rehabilitate , qualify , train , and , subsequently , help young people to enter the labour market .
Syria has oriented all its development plans towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals .
With regard to young people and work in the private sector , many projects have been established , including the BIDAYA programme , whose mission is to work with young people and provide access to financial support for those with a viable business proposition who are unable to find help elsewhere .
The word “ bidaya ” means “ beginning ” in Arabic .
It is also an acronym for “ Boosting and Inspiring Dynamic Youth Achievement ” .
The programme will provide successful applicants with volunteer business mentors and full access to the organization 's local and national business support network .
Another programme for young people , the Syrian Young Entrepreneurs ' Association , was the brainchild of enthusiastic and dedicated young businesspeople who felt that they should make a contribution to the enhancement of the country 's business community by tapping the resources of its most dynamic constituents , young people .
The Syrian Young Entrepreneurs ' Association is a non-governmental / non - profit organization that strives to inspire a strong entrepreneurial mindset and skills among Syria 's promising young people .
It aims to enhance their professional and personal competencies in the national and global economy .
Moreover , the programme seeks to provide a clearinghouse for local and expatriate experiences , there by ensuring a prosperous future for Syria .
Syria 's juvenile delinquency law of 1974 considers delinquent juveniles to be victims .
In 2004 , the Ministry of the Interior , in cooperation with UNICEF , held three training workshops for officers and agents of the criminal security service and the police force on how to interrogate and deal with juveniles .
Finally , I would like to refer to the role of the Syrian Commission for Family Affairs and its contribution to the welfare of young people .
The Commission has shouldered the responsibility for developing the Syrian Arab Republic 's national strategy for young people , by , inter alia , establishing the Youth National Committee , whose members represent all the ministries and State institutions working on youth - related issues , in addition to non-governmental organizations and programmes focusing on young people .
In general , when performing its tasks the Commission takes into consideration issues related to gender , people with special needs and refugees .
Finally , I would like to express our appreciation for the initiative taken by the United Nations to listen to the voices of Member States ' young people , as well as to improve its plans to secure a better future for humankind .
Mr. Atsou ( Togo ) ( spoke in French ) : It is an honour for me to speak on behalf of roughly half of the five million inhabitants of Togo , who are young people , in order to convey to the General Assembly the efforts Togo has made to implement the World Programme of Action for Youth .
Allow me to welcome the presence among us of other delegations , as well as the ongoing efforts they are making to ensure that young people are able to participate in society .
Following summit - level conferences organized by the United Nations , humankind has become aware of the need to address the issue of development comprehensively .
Greater consideration of the matter has made it possible for us to understand the role and invaluable contribution of young people in the process of building a global economy that meets the needs of all , as well as their capacity and willingness to contribute to the lives of their societies .
The world as a whole has also become aware of the risks to which young people are exposed .
The Millennium Declaration and the World Programme of Action for Youth , which was adopted by Member States 10 years ago , are the results of that awareness .
Those tools were conceived with the goal of ameliorating the difficult problems that rob young people of any chance for development , namely , hunger , poverty , unemployment , juvenile delinquency , drug addiction , HIV / AIDS , gender - based discrimination , conflict and marginalization .
Those obstacles , among others , have impeded us from attaining the desired results .
With regard to Togo , there are two main reasons for the lack of progress in implementing the commitments of the World Programme of Action for Youth .
On the one hand , despite the Government 's good will and that of young people 's groups and other actors , the lack of financial resources — a characteristic of most developing States — has been the major limitation to every policy aimed at improving the living standards of young people .
Moreover , Togo has suffered for more than 13 years — and continues to suffer today — from the breakdown in assistance from its main development partners .
On the other hand , in the context of an unfavourable economic environment , the structural adjustment measures recommended by the Bretton Woods institutions have contributed to a suspension of recruitment in the public sector .
Adding to that the low rate at which the private sector is able to absorb young people seeking work and the political crisis in the country , it is easy to understand why Togo 's young people are facing the problems of unemployment , poverty and the other scourges I have mentioned .
Nevertheless , Togo 's young people are today pleased to see that all indicators point to a promising new future .
President Faure Essozimna Gnassingbé has placed the problems of young people at the centre of his programme to structure society on the basis of 20 commitments .
Providing decent employment for young people , extending credit to young entrepreneurs , giving universities the logistical and human resources needed to provide good training for young people , and full and effective participation by youth in the political , economic and social life of the country , are among the main policies of the programme established by Togo 's President .
The Government 's meaningful policy of according close attention to the problems of young people has led to the establishment of the first - ever State secretariat devoted solely to improving conditions for young people .
This is a tool that henceforth will make it possible for us to be the leading actors in the transformation of society .
In addition , the programme of action put forth by the National Union Government , which was made public on 4 July 2005 , sends a strong signal testifying to the resolute determination of the Government of Togo to place the improvement of the living conditions of its young people at the centre of its concerns .
Less than 100 days since the establishment of the National Union Government , the hopes aroused by that event have already been justified vis -à-vis the 10 priority areas targeted by the World Programme of Action for Youth .
In the interests of time , I shall limit myself to pointing out only some of the efforts undertaken in a few areas .
With regard to education , the section in the Government of Togo 's programme of action devoted to social development includes significant steps that should guarantee a quality education for all of Togo 's young people .
Special emphasis has been placed on the situation of teachers , who are mostly young people themselves .
The Government has committed itself to ensure quality education , not only by giving teachers appropriate quality training , but also by providing them working conditions conducive to giving young pupils sound instruction and providing free primary education in order to reach the goal of ensuring schooling for all by 2015 .
For their part , students will be encouraged to excel by the granting of prizes .
In the areas of employment , poverty and hunger , the Government of Togo has taken several steps by which young people will become the most important stakeholders in the building of the Togolese economy .
In that connection , the Prime Minister stated that Togo would do everything necessary with regard to employment in order to ensure that the greatest number of young people possible will be able to benefit from employment as soon as possible .
They will be the first beneficiaries of the employment and self - employment programme to be established by the Government .
They will also be active participants in the reconstruction and consolidation work we are going to undertake .
Putting the Government 's words into action , only some 45 days following the unveiling of its programme , a first wave of 1,700 young teachers were recruited into the civil service . That will be followed by a second wave in the weeks to come .
The provision of grants to young people , which was also announced in the programme , will allow us to promote self - employment through the establishment of small - and medium - sized business .
That will make it possible to reduce considerably the number of the unemployed , thereby also addressing the complicated issue of poverty .
For their part , young people 's groups and non-governmental organizations ( NGO ) working in Togo will also contribute to the extent they are able .
In that connection , I would like to commend the efforts of NGOs to halt the social crisis .
Despite that , however , their efforts to improve the living conditions of young people through sustainable development have been very limited for many years .
We would therefore like to use the forum provided by the General Assembly to launch , on behalf of Togo 's young people , a resounding and solemn appeal aimed at all organizations , associations and other development partners to trust our country and to extend their assistance to our young people , as well as to our Government and our NGOs , in order that we may overcome the challenges of poverty and hunger and the other scourges that particularly afflict young people .
Mr. Ampem ( Ghana ) : May I express my gratitude for the opportunity to address the General Assembly on behalf of the young people of Ghana .
May I also congratulate the United Nations on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond and on the successes in overcoming the challenges regarding its implementation thus far .
Ghana as a country has drawn much inspiration from the World Programme of Action for Youth since its adoption in 1995 , and has been taking bold steps towards the development of Ghanaian young people .
A revised national youth policy , which was developed on the basis of the 10 priority areas identified in the World Programme of Action for Youth , is under active consideration .
Youth organizations under the coordination of the Ghana National Youth Council have also developed a national youth charter to express our priorities as Ghanaian young people .
It should be given attention by all .
In order to further reduce unemployment among young people in the country , the Government has established the National Youth Fund , which is aimed at assisting the country 's young people with funding to establish small - scale enterprises .
Another modest achievement thus far worth mentioning is the introduction of free primary education in the country , which we hope will increase enrolment .
Like many others in the African region , but unlike their counterparts in developed countries , Ghanaian young people benefit the least from today 's globalization .
Issues regarding unfair trade and competition must be seriously addressed if we are genuinely committed to the full integration of the world 's economies and societies , as defined by the World Programme of Action for Youth .
We also ask for well - coordinated and intensive exchange programmes between young people 's organizations in the North and the South in order to facilitate the exchange of ideas and the spread of innovation .
May I take this opportunity to commend the National Council of Swedish Youth Organizations ( LSU ) for taking a bold initiative in that regard .
A case in point is the cooperation between the LSU and the National Union of Ghana Students .
Ghana strongly supports the call for youth - led development , but would like to advise that we not lose sight of the need to tap the rich experiences gained by older generations over the years .
There should be a blend of youthful zeal and the experiences of older persons .
It is gratifying to note that the international community is committed to solving the problem of youth unemployment in the world .
We wish to propose that we ensure that the lion 's share of the resources meant to achieve that are directed to regions of the world where there is a larger percentage of young people — such as Asia and Africa — and where youth unemployment is also the highest .
In conclusion , I wish to emphasize that the successful implementation of the World Programme of Action for Youth and the Millennium Development Goals will depend to a large extent upon the vibrancy of our civil societies .
Developing nations must therefore be encouraged and assisted to develop their civil societies and non-governmental organizations , particularly those related to youth development .
Ms. Al - Hajri ( Qatar ) ( spoke in Arabic ) : I would like to express to the President the gratitude of the delegation of Qatar for having organized this tenth anniversary meeting on the World Programme of Action for Youth for the Year 2000 and Beyond , as well as on the Millennium Development Goals that were adopted after the Programme .
Efforts have been made at the regional , national and international levels ; however , there is still much to be done to reach the Programme 's goals .
The report of the Secretary - General entitled “ World Youth Report 2005 ” ( A/60/61 ) presents the issues and invites us to work hard to find expeditious and appropriate solutions .
The report states that there are over 720 million young people living on two dollars a day or less .
Many must also deal with drug problems and diseases such as AIDS . The gap between young people in developed and developing countries is very wide .
We must try to bridge that gap , especially as regards the areas of educational technology and development , given their effects on young people .
The State of Qatar has been working on all levels to ensure a prosperous future for young people . Our official efforts , as well as those of the private sector and civil society institutions , have been geared towards improving the lives of young people .
Our Supreme Council for Family Affairs , in particular the Department for Youth , has developed a national strategy for youth .
Education in Qatar is guaranteed to all students , and it is compulsory at the primary and secondary levels . We are now focusing our efforts on providing high quality education at all stages , especially at the university level .
We have established an education city , where our major universities operate branches .
We have also focused our efforts on establishing scientific research centres . We have set up centres open to students at all levels , where students practice elections and learn about democracy . We have also integrated disabled persons into teaching programmes .
In order to create employment opportunities , there is coordination between the Government and the private sector to employ young people .
Given that the scourge of drugs is an international phenomenon , we have worked to protect young people from the dangers of drugs .
We have also worked with international institutions to cooperate in this area .
Our Supreme Council for Family Affairs is working with the Centro Italiano di Solidaritá and with United Nations bodies to create opportunities for young people .
That work includes a project under the auspices of the spouse of His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al - Thani and in cooperation with UNESCO to assist Iraqi universities . Qatar has allocated $ 15 million for that purpose .
Our universities are also open to all young people from around the world .
We must make every effort to ensure a prosperous future for young people everywhere .
The United Nations system should contribute advisory and training services to improve the capacities of our young people .
Mr. Al - Ghannam ( Saudi Arabia ) ( spoke in Arabic ) : On behalf of the young people of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , I would like to thank the Secretariat for organizing this international debate to assess the progress made in the implementation of the World Programme of Action for Youth and to provide an opportunity for young people to raise questions with regard to their prospects and aspirations , as well as to take part in the search for solutions .
Allow me to draw the Assembly 's attention to a signal and very positive pioneering experience of Saudi young people — who make up more than two thirds of Saudi society — that took place under the auspices of the King Abdul Aziz Centre for National Dialogue .
That Centre works to foster a culture of dialogue in society that discusses issues of national interest at all levels and proposes recommendations for action . The Centre has made issues impacting young people a national priority .
A national meeting was held in Saudi Arabia under the theme “ Questions of youth : realities and aspirations ” . Twenty - six preparatory workshops were held prior to the meeting , in which 650 young men and women participated , representing young people aged 16 to 25 in groups of 25 men and 25 women from each province .
The goals of the workshops were to promote dialogue among young people , identify and discuss issues and ideas specific to them and , lastly , to consider proposals and work programmes to be submitted to decision - makers .
Many people took part in those workshops , including scientists , intellectual and educated people of both genders and a great number of young men and women . Saudis participating in the workshops had an opportunity to ask many questions and to discuss issues of interest , including continuation of constructive dialogue .
In conclusion , those efforts have begun to bear fruit . They represent an initiative that is led by Saudi Arabia 's young people themselves . They are our hope and we rely heavily on them .
Mr. Treminio Rivera ( Nicaragua ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : I would like to say that I share the pain of the people and Government of El Salvador in connection with the difficulties caused by the hurricane .
I hope that they will be able to overcome those problems .
Nicaragua is not only a country of lakes and volcanoes ; it is also a country full of young people .
Over 70 per cent of the population of Nicaragua is under the age of 30 .
The group of those aged 18 to 30 now represents 23 per cent of the population .
However , by 2015 that group will double to make up 47 per cent of the population , and the group of those aged 0 to 15 , which now makes up 46.5 per cent , will shrink by half .
That means that the Government of Nicaragua should invest in young people today more than ever before .
However , doing so would clearly not be just for the sake of providing replacements for the workforce . It would also be to try to ensure that Nicaraguan young people can become more independent , develop their capacities and enjoy a higher level of participation in society .
When we began to draft social policy for young people in Nicaragua , we tried to ensure that we did so while making those policies part of other national social policies and , ultimately , overall State policy .
Allow me to touch on the positive and negative aspects of the situation of young people in Nicaragua in recent years .
Young people in Nicaragua lived through a war in which more than 50,000 of them died .
Today , as before , we continue to have many problems .
The very high rate of teen pregnancy has resulted in an equally high maternal mortality rate among young women .
People of working age in the 25 - to - 49 - year age bracket have only 7.1 years of schooling on average — that is to say , they do not even have the 12 years of schooling normally recommended by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization .
Adolescents have on average 5.1 years of schooling .
Thus , given the situation facing young Nicaraguans , the Government of Nicaragua has over the past three and half years developed a youth action programme aimed at addressing those problems .
It is endeavouring to elaborate future policies to prevent and treat HIV / AIDS , and it will work with the Ministry of Health to see to it that people living with HIV / AIDS have access to antiretroviral treatment .
The Ministry of Education also must undertake training and educational projects aimed at limiting the pandemic .
Next year we will be carrying out the first youth survey , which will give us an initial baseline as to the actual situation of youth and there by help us adapt our intervention planning aimed at young people .
Access to information and telecommunications technologies is also a challenge for our Government .
That is why we have begun to develop neighbourhood telecommunications centres , there by narrowing the information gap between young people who have access to such information and those who do not .
No less important are sex education programmes , aimed at reducing the number of teen pregnancies and at bringing the Nicaraguan people , especially young people , to a point where the demographic growth rate is lower than the rate of economic growth .
Clearly , however , none of the efforts being made by the Government of Nicaragua will come to fruition if we can not resolve the structural problems facing our country and developing countries in particular .
One important challenge is to reduce external debt with respect to bilateral agencies and to certain countries .
Another important goal is to ensure sustainable economic growth over the next 25 years at an annual rate of 7 per cent , which will enable us to implement state policies that will well and truly resolve the problems facing Nicaragua 's young people .
I should like to join those who have expressed their congratulations to the Ibero - American Youth Organization .
Indeed , on 10 and 11 October , we will be signing the Convention on the Rights of Young People in Latin America in Badajoz , Spain .
I should like to conclude my statement with some thoughts that summarize what youth , and education for youth , means to my Government :
“ If your projects are for one year , plant seeds . If they are for 10 years , plant a tree .
If your projects are for 100 years , then educate the people .
That is because if you plant seeds , you will get one crop .
If you plant a tree , you will get 10 . But if you educate the people , you will have crops forever . ”
The Acting President : I should like to inform the Assembly that the representative of Haiti has asked to participate in this meeting .
Inasmuch as the list of speakers was closed at 11 a.m. today , may I ask the Assembly whether there is any objection to this inclusion of that delegation in the list of speakers .
I see no objection .
Ms. Louis ( Haiti ) ( spoke in French ) : When I learned that I had been appointed by the Secretary of State for Youth to represent Haitian youth at the General Assembly , I hesitated , because on the one hand I know how complex and multifaceted the needs of youth are , and , on the other , I was unsure about the follow - up to such an event .
But , aware that this is an appropriate forum for voicing the claims of our young people , we have come here in the hope that they will be heard and taken into account .
Haitian youth is living and developing in an environment of constant deterioration .
It is deprived of all socio- economic and institutional opportunities , and it can not flourish at the cultural level .
Infrastructure for education , health care , professional training , public hygiene and recreation is lacking , which hinders the development of the collective social conscience that is necessary if we are to transform the existing socio-economic structure into a modern and effective production mechanism .
Despite our Government 's efforts vis-à-vis Haitian youth , we have been unable to devise a policy aimed at promoting the physical and intellectual development of young people — even less so with regard to socio-professional development , which could promote a transition to independence .
Ten years after the elaboration of the Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond , and despite the many recommendations made for youth , the situation of young Haitians has not improved .
For several decades now , the number of young people in Haiti has been growing .
Demographically speaking , it is clear that they now represent a significant percentage of our population .
In 1997 , those aged 15 to 24 years represented 30 per cent of the population .
As the growth rate is nearly 2 per cent annually , just imagine what the employment situation is today .
According to a 1995 United Nations Development Programme report , the unemployment rate was then at 65 per cent .
The socio-political crisis , which grew worse in 2002 , is affecting various sectors of the economy and is having a devastating impact on social indicators .
We believe that unemployment will continue so long as the political crisis is not resolved and so long as there is not greater involvement on the part of young people in the context of a national youth policy that takes account of the Millennium Development Goals and of the actual needs of youth .
HIV / AIDS is one of the greatest challenges of the twenty - first century .
As in the rest of the world , it is having major repercussions for Haitian youth .
The most affected are young people aged 15 to 24 , and those figures are continuing to rise .
The situation is having a negative impact on the development process in the country .
Furthermore , young people who are trying to protect themselves from possible HIV / AIDS infection are having a difficult time getting access to information , counselling , screening and treatment .
In the light of those conditions , it is evident that the limited labour market has no place for urban or rural youth .
That largely explains the phenomenon of boat people prevalent among young people . Young people are driven to migrate .
They take to the seas on flimsy watercraft in search of new horizons .
Among them are young people from rural areas who do not have access to education or plots of land and others who had bad luck on their high school exams , along with all other types of young people , coming from all over the country in search of better economic prospects .
The great majority of those potential immigrants end up living in the shanty towns of Port -au - Prince , where they become involved in criminal activity and are used to foment the climate of insecurity that has existed in the country for several years , since the departure of former President Aristide .
With regard to unemployment and the precariousness of education and social life , Haitian youth are now considering the best type of programme to adopt for our circumstances .
One thing is certain : the policies proposed for industrialized countries are not applicable in our situation .
We therefore propose that the United Nations support our Government in the following manner .
Studies should be designed and carried out on the socio - economic situation of young people in order to create programmes that take their real needs into account .
The international community should support the Government of Haiti in implementing a programme for the social , cultural and intellectual development of young people .
A space should be created within the United Nations for youth representatives from various countries to meet and discuss their problems and the solutions .
In Haiti , the Secretary of State for Youth should be replaced with a Ministry for Youth in order to make actions for youth more effective .
I hope those recommendations will receive consideration .
Mr. Matlosa ( Lesotho ) : I am honoured to have this opportunity to address the Assembly .
Lesotho is one of the poorest nations in the world and has the third highest HIV / AIDS prevalence rate in the world .
The epidemic 's magnitude threatens the very existence of our nation and makes the fight to carry out the World Programme of Action for Youth all the more difficult , if not outright impossible .
Youth must wage war against the epidemic , but that war will be unlike any other war that youth have fought before .
The enemy has crept unnoticed into communities and households , and the silent killer is waging war from within .
Through the World Programme of Action for Youth , the United Nations must urgently elaborate a strategy for its battle plan , seek the assistance of allies , recruit , train and equip troops and allocate enough resources to engage and destroy the enemy .
The United Nations remains our strongest ally in this war .
It should also allocate more resources to that war and remain determined in helping youth emerge victorious .
From my statement , it is clear that HIV / AIDS is one of the biggest obstacles to achieving our goals in the World Programme of Action for Youth , as well as the overall development of the youth .
While Lesotho has made tremendous progress in its efforts to provide the fundamental elements needed to improve livelihoods , young people face considerable development challenges , primarily due to the HIV / AIDS pandemic .
In a country with one of the highest infection rates , now estimated at approximately 30 per cent , the youth of Lesotho are facing an unprecedented challenge .
The pandemic , combined with deep - rooted poverty and food insecurity , is causing a new kind of vulnerability , affecting almost every young person in Lesotho .
The consequence is a gradual undermining of the social and economic fabric that makes up the society of Lesotho .
The pandemic has a great effect on youth , weakening family and social coping mechanisms .
Youth are in crisis . That complex crisis can be seen in its negative impact on youth development , and in particular on the realization of the World Programme of Action for Youth .
However , the socio- political climate now prevailing in most developing countries provides a real opportunity to effectively address youth development challenges such as the HIV / AIDS pandemic , poverty and hunger , unemployment , globalization and gender equality .
For us in the developing countries , the idea of achieving the goals of the World Programme of Action for Youth is just a dream .
Our dream can be made a reality through further support and investment from the United Nations and developed countries .
Today , we young people live in a world that you adults and our forefathers have made .
Tomorrow , you will live in a world that we will make .
When you make decisions , think of the world in which you would like to live in the future .
Our crisis can be turned into an opportunity .
Young people , let us all rally to the battle cry and make a difference .
The Acting President : I now call on the observer of the Observer State of the Holy See.
Mr. Dionísio ( Holy See ) : My delegation is pleased to participate in this important discussion on the World Programme of Action for Youth .
It was once said , flippantly , that youth is wasted on the young .
Nevertheless , the Holy See is pleased that the United Nations continues to have high regard for the importance of young people .
Recently , at a gathering of hundreds of thousands of young people in Cologne , Germany , Pope Benedict XVI echoed the sentiments of young people around the world when he said , “ We are concerned for the state of the world and we are asking , ` where do I find standards to live by and what are the criteria that govern responsible cooperation in building the present and the future of our world ? ' ”
Young people aspire to be great .
But to achieve greatness , they must be mindful of others , especially those in need .
Nor can they achieve greatness alone .
They need the leadership and the resources of Governments , the interest and the cooperation of non-governmental organizations and the goodwill and hard work of all people .
In the light of that concern , my delegation has carefully followed developments since the launch 10 years ago of the World Programme of Action for Youth . Its 10 priority areas for action touched upon significant issues and themes that affect the lives of young people and our world .
The Secretary - General 's World Youth Report 2005 ( A/60/61 ) returns to troubling elements that still affect young people 's lives today .
Addressing one of those concerns , my delegation reaffirms its position on the use of the expression “ sexual and reproductive health ” , as contained in the report .
My delegation understands the concept as the holistic promotion of the health of women , men , youth and children .
It does not consider abortion or access to abortion to be a dimension of that term .
The Holy See also continues to be fully committed to the role of youth in the context of the global economy , poverty , education and employment .
There are currently more than 196,000 Catholic primary and secondary schools worldwide , attended by more than 51 million children and young people .
Furthermore , there are almost 1,000 Catholic universities , colleges and other institutes , educating more than 4 million young adults .
Young people are being helped to receive the education they deserve and are encouraged to give back to others .
Education is the gift that continues to give .
The President returned to the Chair .
With respect to youth in relation to society , the environment , leisure and participation , the Catholic Church , through the activities of thousands of youth groups throughout the world , promotes the importance of caring for oneself , for the environment and for one 's peers .
Almost 12,000 Catholic hospitals and other health - care and preventive medicine institutions throughout the world are working to address problems related to youth at risk , including health issues , drugs , delinquency and discrimination against girls and young women .
Trained local professionals working in such institutions support the principle that all human life is sacred , and that each person has worth .
The young are cared for as precious and vulnerable members of society .
The ability to accomplish specific goals in the 10 priority areas comes down to commitment .
The round - table discussions on young people called it “ making commitments that matter ” .
We know that we live in a complex and complicated world , and many young people know that such a commitment requires three things : recognizing needs , especially in the poorest countries of our world ; planning a response ; and following through .
The Holy See encourages the United Nations to continue to identify the needs of the world 's young people , especially the poorest and weakest of them . It further recommits itself to working together with the international community to develop realistic , appropriate , immediate and long - term responses .
Building a better world is a lifelong process .
Oftentimes , it is a very long journey .
But young people recognize that their journey is just beginning .
And , precisely because they are young , they are still at the initial stages of paving a path for success in the future .
Every person of every age matters as we work together to build a world in which young people can feel safe and happy .
The President : In accordance with General Assembly resolution 3369 ( XXX ) of 10 October 1975 , I call on the observer for the Organization of the Islamic Conference .
Mr. Husain ( Organization of the Islamic Conference ) : It is a privilege for me to address the General Assembly on the occasion of its review of the progress made in the implementation of the World Programme of Action for Youth , which the Assembly adopted 10 years ago .
The Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) expresses its full support for the initiatives being undertaken by Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations worldwide for the observance of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the World Programme of Action for Youth .
In doing so , we recall with pride and pleasure the role and active participation of OIC member States in the drafting and adoption of the Programme of Action and in its implementation at the national , regional and global levels .
The results of those planned endeavours are now before us , meticulously detailed in the Secretary - General 's report ( A/60/61 ) and described in our debate by speakers from all over the world , including from OIC member States .
What is emerging from this invaluable interchange of ideas and experiences is the fact that , while advances have been made to varying degrees in the 10 priority areas on which the Programme of Action focuses , the expectations raised in 1995 have not been met .
In 2005 , over 200 million young people are living in poverty ; 130 million are illiterate ; 88 million are unemployed ; and — something that was not , perhaps , fully foreseen 10 years ago — 10 million young people are now living with HIV / AIDS .
We have no option but to share the Secretary - General 's view that , given such stark and startling realities , the case for renewing our commitment to the goals of the World Programme of Action could not be clearer .
In fact , there is a stronger case now for augmenting the 10 priority issues of 1995 by another five , as identified in the World Youth Report 2003 ( E / CN.5/2003/ 4 ) , and subsequently noted by the Assembly in resolution 58/133 .
We would like to take this opportunity to bring to the Assembly 's attention some of the developments that are under way in the OIC in support of the interests of youth .
First , the Islamic Conference Youth Forum for Dialogue and Cooperation has been established .
The Forum , whose headquarters are in Istanbul , will , among other things , become a credible source of information and advice on national youth policy issues , coordinate the activities of national youth organizations in OIC member States and Muslim communities in non-member States , and assist with capacity - building measures , including the training of youth leaders in advocacy and organizational roles .
Those two examples should give representatives a sense of the OIC 's commitment to the welfare and development of youth .
Those commitments do not exist in isolation , but reflect the emphasis placed by our organization on the promotion of Islamic family values and , in that context , on efforts to address the needs of the various elements of the family , including men , women , children and youth .
In conclusion , we believe that , with renewed strength , the family — the basic social unit of society — should provide the tools for the development of a morally upright and economically stable , healthy and viable society .
It should also create an environment for harmonious and productive lives to be lived by all members of the human family , including youth , on whose shoulders will fall the responsibility of creating the global village , which is our destination in the new millennium , which we recently entered .
The President : We have heard the last speaker in the debate at this meeting devoted to the evaluation of the progress made in the implementation of the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond .
The Assembly will now take a decision on draft resolution A / 60 / L.2 , entitled “ Policies and programmes involving youth ” , as orally revised .
The list of additional sponsors — like the original list of sponsors — is impressive .
The following countries have added their names to the list of sponsors of draft resolution A / 60 / L.2 : Algeria , Botswana , Burkina Faso , Cape Verde , China , the Congo , Djibouti , Fiji , Gabon , Israel , Jamaica , Malawi , Panama , Papua New Guinea , Sierra Leone , Ukraine and the United Republic of Tanzania .
May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution A / 60 / L.2 , as orally revised ?
Draft resolution A / 60 / L.2 , as orally revised , was adopted ( resolution 60 / 2 ) .
The President : Before giving the floor to the representative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela , who wishes to speak in explanation of position on the resolution just adopted , may I remind delegations that explanations of vote or position are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats .
Ms. García- Matos ( Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela wishes to express its strong reservation with regard to paragraph 7 of draft resolution A / 60 / L.2 .
We totally disagree with the contents of that paragraph , which mentions the outcome document ( resolution 60 / 1 ) of the High - level Plenary Meeting of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly .
We consider that document to be null and void and as having no effect for the Republic .
The President : We have heard the only speaker in explanation of position .
I shall now call on those representatives who wish to speak in exercise of the right of reply .
May I remind members that statements in exercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to five minutes for the second and should be made by delegations from their seats .
Ms. Shestack ( United States of America ) : The United States is exercising its right of reply in response to the statement made this morning by the representative of Cuba .
The United States trade embargo against Cuba is a bilateral issue that should not come before the General Assembly .
In bringing attention to that issue , Cuba is simply attempting to blame the communist regime 's failed economic policies on the United States and to divert attention from its human rights record .
Let us remember that the United States is the single largest source of humanitarian assistance to Cuba .
Let there be no doubt : if Cubans are jobless or hungry , it is because of the failings of the current Government .
That Government has shown no interest whatsoever in implementing any economic or political reform that would lead to democratic change and a free - market economy .
That kind of economic mismanagement is the reason why a country that 45 years ago had a per capita income equal to that of Spain is now one of Latin America 's most economically desperate .
The Cuban Government is not a victim , as it contends . Rather , it is a tyrant aggressively punishing anyone who dares to have a differing opinion .
Castro has steadfastly refused to allow any kind of political opening , and he continues to deny Cubans human rights and fundamental freedoms as set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
We , for one , can not support an economic opening with a country with such an abysmal record on economic and political issues .
Ms. Thomas ( Cuba ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : Cuba is not trying to blame the United States .
Actually , the United States is only blaming itself ; it does not need our help .
It is blaming itself by not complying with the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly over the past 13 years calling for a lifting of the blockade .
It is blaming itself when it adopts extraterritorial laws against Cuba hardening the blockade even more and when it applies them so brutally .
The prosperous Cuba of before 1 January 1959 that the representative of the United States is talking about was a Cuba of 2 million illiterate people — 40 per cent of the population .
It was a Cuba of half a million unschooled children , 10,000 unemployed schoolteachers and a jobless rate of 24 per cent , with young people the majority of the unemployed .
It was a Cuba of drunken American marines on the streets of Havana , defiling our national monuments , and of Fulgencio Batista , killing and torturing students with the tacit complicity of American leaders .
The United States delegation is trying to convince those in this Hall that the blockade is nothing more than a Cuban excuse for our problems .
It is trying to be my country 's judge and prosecutor , using the argument that we supposedly lack democracy and violate human rights .
Not only does it ignore Cuba 's globally recognized progress in the social arena and in caring for young people and children , but it is lying once again to the members of the Assembly when it tries to present the economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba as a bilateral issue .
Only a racist , fascist , arrogant , haughty and , indeed , disturbed mentality such as that of the current President of the United States , Mr. Bush , could maintain the criminal blockade against Cuba .
In practice , the blockade policy amounts to an actual economic war waged by the United States against my country for more than 40 years without any limits , whether ethical , moral or related to State obligations under international law governed by the United Nations .
Never has a country been subjected so continuously to the danger represented by such a powerful neighbour , which , historically , has tried to dominate and annex us for more than two centuries .
The United States has run out of pretexts for explaining the maintenance of the criminal blockade and other anti-Cuban measures .
That is why it clings to the issue of our supposed violations of human rights .
That is the fig leaf with which it covers itself .
The world knows that for the past 46 years , Cuba has been a thorn in the side of the world 's only super - Power , the United States .
When it becomes irritated , it sets in motion a campaign of disinformation , blackmail and pressure .
Everyone here is aware that what the United States delegation is trying to do on behalf of it s Government is to stigmatize Cuba for our unyielding rebellion against the unjust imperialist world order ; for our staunch defence of our independence and sovereignty ; for our decision to make our own way without accepting external interference ; for the example set by our truly participatory and popular democracy ; for the example set by our achievements , including our education and health rates , our full employment and our social justice for all , despite the cruel and prolonged blockade that our people have had for so long to endure ; and for the example we set by providing solidarity and sharing what we have with those who have nothing in this world .
The Government of United States has not the slightest moral qualification to speak about Cuba or any other country represented in this Hall .
The Government that is accusing Cuba today is the one that has sent thousands of its young people to die in wars launched under lying pretexts now internationally recognized as such .
It is the Government that directed — indeed , participated in — the bombing of cities .
The Government that is accusing Cuba today is the one that was unable to take measures in time to prevent the disaster caused in New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina .
In Cuba , we learned long ago to raise dignity as high as palm trees , and there will be no turning back .
Cuba will not rest in its struggle , will not surrender , will never make concessions , will never fail to speak up .
We will always stand alongside those who are not resigned , those who put their faith in the value of ideas and principles , those who do not give up the dream of achieving full justice for all in a better world .
The President : I should now like to say a few final words as President of the General Assembly .
Yesterday and today have been marked by a strong presence of both the present and the future in this Hall .
I refer not only to those who are here representing youth organizations in their own countries , and , of course , to the representatives of Governments .
In that regard , I particularly commend the delegation of Togo for its most faithful participation in the discussions .
It is welcome to see so many participants still here at almost 7 p.m . That is a good sign , and I am grateful .
Participants have also brought to the United Nations the presence and situation of young people throughout the world , who are so vulnerable in conflicts , who are vulnerable to disease and who are exposed to poverty , at a time when so many moral excesses are making children victims , for example as child soldiers .
We also face the trafficking of human beings , which is , as we know , a modern form of slavery .
We have brought into these rooms not only young people representing youth but also the realities of the situation of many young people in the world .
This is important and indeed very rejuvenating for this Organization at a time of reform and looking to the future .
We need to strengthen multilateralism ; we need to strengthen international cooperation ; we need to strengthen international solidarity .
Young people have a very important role to play in this regard .
I hope that they will take back to their countries a message of international cooperation , a message of strengthening this Organization and a message of international solidarity .
I also hope that they have created networks among themselves .
Relations among human beings are extremely important , even in diplomacy .
And I hope that this network will bring our young participants together even after they leave these halls .
With these words , I thank all participants for making this a very special two - day part of the General Assembly at the beginning of my presidency .
I wish them a good return to their countries , countries that they have represented so well , and the best of luck for the future .

“ The Security Council welcomes the desire of the international community and the Afghan government to agree a new framework for international engagement beyond the completion of the Bonn political process .
The Council expresses , in this regard , its readiness to review , based on the report of the Secretary - General to be submitted in accordance with its resolution 1589 ( 2005 ) , and in the light of consultations the United Nations will have with the Government of Afghanistan and all concerned international actors , the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan ( UNAMA ) after the completion of the electoral process , in order to allow the United Nations to continue to play a vital role in the post -Bonn period .
The Council is also ready to consider the renewal of the mandate of ISAF prior to its expiration , upon the request of the Government of Afghanistan . ”

Item 116 of the provisional agenda*
Implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations
Letter dated 12 August 2005 from the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary - General
With reference to the letters recently addressed to you by Chad and a very few other countries ( A /60/192 , A/60/193 ) , I have been instructed to solemnly state China 's position , as follows :
The above - mentioned countries , in brazen violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and in defiance of General Assembly resolution 2758 ( XXVI ) , have once again requested the issue of the so - called “ Taiwan 's participation in the United Nations ” to be considered at the coming session of the General Assembly .
They have also requested the consideration of the so - called “ proactive role for the United Nations in maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait ” .
The Chinese Government and people strongly condemn and firmly oppose such a gross encroachment on China 's internal affairs .
Taiwan is a part of China 's territory and has never been a country .
There is only one China in the world , and China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity brook no division .
Though reunification is yet to be realized between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait , the fact that both the mainland and Taiwan belong to one China has never been changed , and this is the status quo of cross -Strait relations .
This is an objective reality that nobody can change or deny .
To date , more than 160 countries have established diplomatic relations with China .
They all recognize the one - China principle and that Taiwan is a part of China .
This is also the principle that the United Nations has consistently adhered to .
In 1971 , at its twenty - sixth session , the General Assembly adopted by an overwhelming majority the historic resolution 2758 ( XXVI ) , which stipulated unequivocally that the representatives of the Government of the People 's Republic of China are the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations .
Thus was the issue of China 's representation in the United Nations solved once and for all .
Since Taiwan is a region of China , China 's representation in the United Nations naturally includes Taiwan .
There is simply no such issue as the so - called “ Taiwan 's representation in the United Nations ” .
Any attempt to distort or even deny resolution 2758 ( XXVI ) is futile .
The United Nations is an intergovernmental organization composed of sovereign States .
As a part of China , Taiwan is not eligible to participate , under whatever name , in the United Nations and its specialized agencies .
The General Committee of the successive sessions of the General Assembly since 1993 has flatly rejected the inclusion of the so - called issue of “ Taiwan 's participation in the United Nations ” in the agenda of the General Assembly .
This has fully demonstrated the determination of the vast number of Member States to safeguard the Charter of the United Nations and resolution 2758 ( XXVI ) .
It also shows that the Taiwan authorities will never receive international support in their attempt to split China by raising the so - called issue of “ Taiwan 's participation in the United Nations ” .
The question of Taiwan is a purely internal matter of China .
The position of the Chinese Government on the question of Taiwan is firm and clear .
We have consistently adhered to the fundamental principle of “ peaceful reunification and one country , two systems ” and the “ Eight - point Proposal on the Development of Cross - Strait Relations and the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of the Motherland ” .
On 4 March 2005 , President Hu Jintao set forth four - point guidelines on cross -Strait relations under the new circumstances , which have been warmly acclaimed by the compatriots on both sides of the Strait and received wide attention in the world .
Adherence to the one - China principle is the cornerstone for developing cross -Strait relations and realizing peaceful reunification .
We have always advocated cross-Strait dialogues and negotiations on the basis of the one - China principle .
Not long ago , Lien Chan , Chairman of the Chinese Kuomintang Party , James Soong , Chairman of the People First Party , and Yu Mu-ming , Chairman of the New Party , paid successful visits to the mainland , at the invitation of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and its General Secretary , Hu Jintao .
General Secretary Hu held formal talks with each of them , during which the two sides had a sincere , frank and in - depth exchange of views on major issues relating to cross-Strait relations and inter-party ties . These visits help move cross-Strait relations towards peace and stability , serve the common interests of people on both sides of the Strait and conform to the aspiration of Taiwan compatriots for peace , stability and development , receiving broad support from people on both sides of the Strait and winning full recognition by the international community .
It must be pointed out that in recent years , significant and complex changes have taken place on the island of Taiwan , where the “ Taiwan independence ” secessionists have intensified their secessionist activities , having serious impacts on the peaceful and stable development of cross -Strait relations .
This has increasingly become the biggest obstacle to the growth of cross -Strait relations , as well as the biggest immediate threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait .
For the purpose of opposing and checking Taiwan 's secession from China by secessionists in the name of “ Taiwan independence ” , promoting peaceful national reunification , maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait , preserving China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation , the National People 's Congress of China adopted the Anti-Secession Law on 14 March this year .
This legislation , while identifying the nature of the Taiwan question , codifies the Chinese Government 's basic guidelines on the Taiwan question as well as the relevant major policies and important propositions it has implemented or advanced over the years .
The law also harmonizes the principles and guidelines on the settlement of the Taiwan question in an integrated fashion and embodies our position that , on the premise of one China , any topic can be discussed between the two sides across the Strait .
The provisions in the law have given full expression to our consistent position and proposition for the prospect of peaceful reunification with utmost efforts and maximum sincerity , and at the same time have demonstrated the common will of the entire Chinese people to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
The Anti-Secession Law is a domestic law of China and a defensive measure for safeguarding State sovereignty and territorial integrity and for bringing about the prospect of peaceful reunification .
In view of the immense destructiveness of the secessionist activities in the name of “ Taiwan independence ” to cross -Strait relations and the severe threat they pose to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the Asia-Pacific region at large , the Anti-Secession Law provides for taking non-peaceful means to stop Taiwan 's secession from China by the “ Taiwan independence ” forces .
It must be pointed out here that we are willing to strive for peaceful reunification with maximum sincerity and utmost efforts .
Nevertheless , no sovereign State can tolerate secession .
Non-peaceful means to stop Taiwan 's secession from China by the “ Taiwan independence ” forces will be used only as a last resort , only when our efforts for a peaceful reunification prove completely futile .
Therefore , the Anti-Secession Law is of great importance for opposing and checking the reckless secessionist activities in the name of “ Taiwan independence ” , and for maintaining peace , stability and prosperity in the Taiwan Strait and the Asia- Pacific region .
It is the “ Taiwan independence ” secessionist activities perpetrated by the Taiwan authorities that are the real source of tension in the Taiwan Strait .
The Taiwan authorities must abandon their secessionist position and stop all secessionist activities in the name of “ Taiwan independence ” so that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait can be maintained .
To safeguard State sovereignty and territorial integrity and realize complete national reunification at an early date is the common aspiration and strong will of the 1.3 billion Chinese people , including our Taiwan compatriots .
Nobody nor any force can change or stop it .
Respect for State sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in a country 's internal affairs are important principles of the Charter of the United Nations , cherished by all countries in the world .
China has strictly followed those principles in its relations with other countries .
China has never done anything harmful to the interests of the above - mentioned co-sponsor countries , but what those countries have been doing regarding the question of Taiwan under the instigation of the Taiwan authorities has undermined the national interests of China and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people .
It has also gravely obstructed the work of the General Assembly .
We strongly urge those countries to change their positions , strictly abide by the Charter of the United Nations and resolution 2758 ( XXVI ) and identify themselves with the great number of Member States on the Taiwan question .
We highly appreciate the right position adopted by the United Nations and the vast number of Member States in abiding by the one - China principle .
We have every reason to believe that in our just cause of safeguarding State sovereignty and territorial integrity , the Chinese Government and people will continue to receive their understanding and support .
I have the honour to request that the present letter be circulated as a document of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly under item 116 of its provisional agenda .

Item 3 . Methodologies , classifications , quantification and development impacts of non-tariff barriers ( NTBs )
The Commission on Trade in Goods and Services , and Commodities , at its ninth session , decided to convene an expert meeting on non-tariff barriers ( NTBs ) .
The São Paulo Consensus , in paragraph 77 , provided that efforts at extending market access liberalization for non-agricultural products under the Doha Work Programme should be intensified with the aim of reducing or , as appropriate , eliminating , inter alia , non-tariff barriers , in particular on products of export interest to developing countries .
Accordingly , the expert meeting will consider and analyse issues of relevance to NTBs from this perspective
The continual decline of tariff rates as a result of eight multilateral trade negotiations has raised the relative importance of NTBs in terms of both protection and regulatory trade instruments .
Initial efforts at measuring and collecting NTB data at the multilateral level date back to the early 1980s , when UNCTAD pioneered the intellectual efforts by developing a taxonomy of different types of NTBs , establishing the UNCTAD Coding System of Trade Control Measures .
Since then , all collected information has been classified and coded according to the above - mentioned Coding System , and the UNCTAD data have been disseminated publicly , in more recent years as part of the UNCTAD Trade Analysis and Information System ( TRAINS ) .
The data have been widely used by Governments , research institutions and NGOs , resulting in numerous publications .
The discussions under this substantive item will serve to provide UNCTAD member States with better opportunities to : identify ways to improve , in terms of both country coverage and data quality , the NTB database contained in TRAINS ; clarify methodologies for defining and classifying NTBs according to their nature and source , including clusters of NTBs that are already subject to WTO disciplines ; discuss options on how to deal with NTBs in terms of analysing their relative restrictive impacts on trade , including through strengthening existing analytical instruments such as the TRAINS data base ; and review econometric approaches to calculate tariff equivalents of NTBs that could be applied to improve understanding of NTBs ' role in world trade .
The Meeting will also look at experiences of other international organizations in dealing with NTBs , including the WTO , the World Bank , ITC and OECD .
To facilitate the discussion , the UNCTAD secretariat has prepared a background note entitled “ Methodologies , classifications , quantification and development impacts of non-tariff barriers ( NTBs ) ” .

Item 9 of the provisional agenda
Industrial development , trade and poverty alleviation through South - South cooperation
Issue paper submitted by the Secretariat
In resolution GC.10 / Res.4 the Conference recommended to make industrial development , trade and poverty alleviation through South - South cooperation a theme of the Industrial Development Forum during the eleventh session of the General Conference .
The present issue paper raises a number of issues for an informed discussion .
Keynote speakers will attempt to provide answers to critical questions put forward in the present document .
The origin of South - South cooperation can be traced to the creation of the Group of 77 ( G-77 ) in 1964 to promote economic and technical cooperation among developing countries .
In 1974 , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) created a Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries ( SU / TCDC ) .
The historic Buenos Aires Plan of Action for Promoting and Implementing Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries , adopted in September 1978 ( A / RES / 33/134 ) and endorsing TCDC , further strengthened the aspirations of developing countries in promoting economic cooperation among themselves as a complement to North - South cooperation , forging a global South .
A High - Level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries ( ECDC ) held at Caracas in 1981 urged negotiations on a Global System of Trade Preferences ( GSTP ) among developing countries to promote joint initiatives in marketing and technology transfer .
In 2003 , the United Nations General Assembly formally opted to use the term South - South instead of ECDC / TCDC in describing cooperation among developing countries ( A / RES / 58/220 ) .
The same resolution declared 19 December as the United Nations Day for South - South Cooperation , an annual event to review achievements , challenges and opportunities .
Broad areas of South - South cooperation
Given the current context of globalization and trade liberalization creating competitive pressures for efficiency gains and the global development agenda for achieving the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) , South - South cooperation can be seen as encompassing , among other things , four broad areas : ( a ) industrial trade , investment and technology flows among developing countries ; ( b ) common positions to address discriminatory elements of global trade norms ; ( c ) a joint response to poverty reduction ; and ( d ) a strategic exchange of experience and know - how .
Regional groupings among developing countries are endeavouring to achieve the above objectives within the framework of preferential trade agreements .
But a wider spectrum of initiatives among developing countries is needed to address jointly a number of issues related to South - South cooperation .
A number of questions related to pertinent issues are grouped under the four broad areas of South - South cooperation mentioned in chapter I.
Industrial trade , technology and investment flows
( a ) Is increased global integration a prerequisite for enhancing South - South trade , technology and investment flows ?
( b ) Will South - South industrial trade , technology and investment flows reshape the pattern of industrialization based on comparative advantages ?
( c ) What are the determinants of successful South - South cooperation in industrial development for poverty reduction ?
( d ) How can the tradeability and adaptability of South technology be facilitated ?
( e ) Will the rise of a few developing countries as economic superpowers influence South - South trade , technology and investment flows ?
( f ) What are the most promising sources of funding for South - South trade , technology and investment flows ?
Common position in global trade talks and negotiations
( a ) How do global trade negotiations affect South - South cooperation ?
( b ) Can the lead ( pivotal ) countries of the South play an effective role in addressing the unresolved elements of trade negotiations ?
( c ) Can trade liberalization lead to effective poverty reduction ?
C . A joint response to poverty reduction
( a ) Can South - South cooperation generate income and employment opportunities for the rural and urban poor ?
( b ) How can primary producers ' livelihoods be protected / improved through South - South cooperation ?
( c ) How can grass - roots innovations be promoted through South - South cooperation in reducing extreme poverty ?
( d ) What should be the role of multilateral assistance in making South - South cooperation work better for the poor ?
Exchange of experience and know - how
( a ) Can South - South networking between research institutions commercialize existing research findings ?
( b ) Is free trade in consultancy and technology - related services among developing countries feasible ?
( c ) How can information and communication technologies be used as an effective means to exchange experience and know - how ?
INDUSTRIAL TRADE , TECHNOLOGY AND INVESTMENT FLOWS
Wealth creation through productivity enhancement can lead to significant poverty reduction .
Productivity growth stems from enhanced adaptive capabilities to use modern technology and commercialize new knowledge .
Trade , investment and technology flows play a crucial role in productivity catch - up .
Critical issues of wealth creation within the framework of South - South cooperation will need to be addressed to spread the benefits of growth .
Failing this , there will be growth without development .
North - South and South - South trade : Possible marginalization within the South
South - South cooperation can not take place in isolation of the integration of developing countries into the global economy .
It would therefore be wrong to assume that South - South cooperation in industrialization and trade is a complete substitute for North - South trade .
It would equally be wrong to assume that North - South trade is sufficient to guarantee building the necessary capacity for addressing the issues of poverty reduction in the South .
The fastest growing export items in South - South trade are products which benefit significantly from global connectivity and the global production network ( GPN ) ( Lall , Sanjaya and Albaladejo , Manuel , 2005 ) .
While global integration is critical for keeping developing countries abreast of the new industrial realities , there seem to be inconclusive research findings on the sources of global integration creating dramatic improvements in domestic capability - building in developing countries ( Rasiah , Raja , 2004 ) .
Another issue that needs to be raised is that of industrial and trade marginalization within the developing world rather than between North and South due to the outstanding performance of a few developing countries .
In North - South trade unskilled workers have benefited in the South , but the gains have been concentrated on those with skills in the North ( Wood , Adrian , 1995 ) .
Will the same situation emerge with industrially more advanced countries in the South attracting skill - based activities and skills ? Will least developed countries ( LDCs ) be further marginalized ?
B. South - South cooperation reshaping the pattern of industrial development
Preferential trade liberalization in the Mercado Común del Cono Sur ( MERCOSUR ) seems to have favoured a reshaping of manufacturing production according to regional comparative advantage ( Sanguinetti , Pablo , et al. , 2004 ) .
Comparative advantages are derived from resource endowments , and competitiveness stems from firm - centred initiatives .
The challenge is thus to convert comparative advantages into competitiveness .
Today industrialization is not driven by resource endowments alone , but by technology , knowledge , skills , information , innovation , research and development , and networking .
How can South - South cooperation create an enabling environment for developing countries to benefit from new knowledge being created by Southern universities , exploited by Southern institutions and laboratories and commercialized by Southern firms within the framework of cohesive networking ?
C . Determinants of the degree of South - South cooperation in industrial development and trade
Trade in similar but differentiated products seems critical for strengthening South - South cooperation in the sphere of industrial development .
Given the varying degrees of industrialization and levels of income across developing countries , the scope for producing similar but differentiated products seems limited .
Identification of labour - intensive products that can participate in intra-industry trade is critical , and analyses of value chain potentials are equally important .
There is solid evidence that the benefits of intra-industry trade vary depending upon the nature of the industry and the intensity of the fragmentation .
Although domestic capabilities matter , a number of factors affect intra-industry trade patterns in the developing world .
For success among developing countries with similar factor endowments , intra-industry transactions should evolve ( Shigeru , Otsubo , 1998 ) .
The more fragmented an industry , the more likely that several countries are able to participate in the production process through global production networks ( Lall , Sanjaya and Albaladejo , Manuel , 2005 ) .
The issue is related to enhanced adaptive capabilities to participate in fragmented production spread across countries .
D. Tradeability and adaptability of South technology and intellectual property rights
To ensure the tradeability of technology , it is imperative that the technology be appropriate and adaptable .
Technologies that are sourced from both South and North call for a proper needs assessment of technology requirements in a country - specific context .
It seems clear that strong intellectual property rights ( IPRs ) protection can hinder rather than facilitate technology transfer and indigenous learning in the early stages of industrialization .
Only after countries have accumulated sufficient indigenous capabilities with extensive science and technology infrastructure to undertake creative imitation does IPR protection become an important element in technology transfer and industrial activities .
Therefore , if adequate protection and enforcement of IPRs is genuinely intended to enhance development , differentiation in terms of the level of economic development is needed .
E . The rising economic powers in the South
As a few countries emerge as major economic superpowers and important trade partners , such as China and India , the impact across developing countries may be uneven .
In this context , the findings of a recent study ( Department for International Development ( DFID ) of the United Kingdom , 2005 ) on the effect of China 's and India 's growth and trade liberalization on poverty in Africa merit attention .
The emergence of China and India presents both opportunities and challenges in terms of complementarity and competitive effects .
Cheap imports from China and India may increase the real income of the urban poor .
But those imports may also erase a number of manufacturing activities , with negative impact on employment opportunities .
Will the export profile of African countries exporting to China and India have a significant positive impact on the poor in Africa ?
Financing South - South trade , technology and investment flows
In the absence of efficient sources of financing , the transaction costs of South - South trade , technology and investment flows will be increased .
A range of financial services is needed to address the issue and to support South - South trade .
A network of export credit agencies , efficient payment and credit guarantee arrangements , and local banks supporting trade capacity - building institutions are a few options that may be considered .
If a high import intensity of export orientation evolves among developing countries , a possible vulnerability may stem from the import intensity of export orientation being financed by short - term lenders as evidenced by the East Asian financial crisis .
Is the creation of a special fund and financial services for South - South trade , technology and investment flows a viable option ?
Can public - private partnership address effectively finance - related matters within the framework of South - South cooperation ?
Implications of trade negotiations
Developing country delegations in multilateral trade negations have become active in forming bargaining coalitions .
The basic principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade / World Trade Organization ( GATT / WTO ) system are sound : treat all nations outside one 's national frontiers as being equal ; and treat all commodities that have entered one 's territory on parity .
The main bottleneck in the WTO negotiations is related to the agriculture sector , which is the principle source of livelihood for the poor in developing countries .
Two other contentious issues are related to the agreement on Trade - Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ( TRIPS ) , and the system for settlement of disputes in the WTO .
The negotiations of the two issues have presented several difficulties for developing countries .
Though trade negotiations fell short of expectations in Doha and Cancun , unity among the countries of the South did emerge , with the formation of Group 21 , including the largest ( Brazil , China and India ) to fight for concerns which were not adequately addressed .
Does it necessarily entail greater cooperation among developing countries in the spheres of industrialization and trade ?
The role of lead ( pivotal ) countries
Lead or pivotal countries can be defined as developing countries which , by virtue of their capacities and experience are positioned to play a “ lead ” role in the promotion and application of technical cooperation activities through South - South cooperation .
These activities are in particular those that are capable of withstanding competitive pressures for efficiency gains and surviving the new industrial and trade realities .
What are the contours and tenets of an enabling environment that can facilitate the role of the pivotal countries ?
C . Trade liberalization and poverty reduction
In developing countries tariff revenue accounts for 10 - 20 per cent of government revenue .
Will the loss of revenue due to tariff reductions be duly compensated for by productivity and employment gains in a liberalized trading environment ?
Will developing countries lose or gain from trade liberalization in important sectors , the development of which contributes to poverty reduction ?
Does the sequencing of trade liberalization matter ?
The formidable challenge of developing countries is to create sustainable sources of livelihoods in an internationally competitive environment and there by contribute to the achievement of the MDGs .
Can it be done more effectively by a cohesive South - South response ?
Income and employment creation
The emerging pattern of production may demand free mobility of labour with enhanced skills , knowledge and adaptive capabilities .
But free movement of labour across manufacturing activities hinges on a number of factors .
Knowledge and skill flows are facilitated by worker mobility to industries that are similar to their industry of origin ( Saxenian , AnnaLee , 1994 ) .
It is generally believed that in a high employment and high growth environment workers with accumulated knowledge and skills can usefully be deployed from declining industries to rising industries , leading to the optimal allocation of labour .
In contrast , in high unemployment and slow growth environment , even if workers have accumulated knowledge and skills , there may be limited labour mobility and employment .
A distinction needs to be drawn between growth industries and livelihood industries .
Growth industries are those , which benefit from new sources of dynamic industrial growth .
Livelihood industries are those , which assure sustainable sources of livelihoods for the rural poor .
Can South - South cooperation provide a strong strategic and programmatic focus on the effective development of both dynamic industries and livelihood industries ?
B. Protecting / improving the livelihoods of primary producers
Producers of primary commodities often suffer from the low prices paid to them .
Can South - South trade in semi - processed goods for further processing , and in partially processed goods for processing into final agro-industry related products , be translated into enhanced income to primary producers ? Will intra-South value chain development contribute significantly to poverty reduction ? On what basis can promising products for intra-South value chains be identified ?
C. Grass - roots innovations and rural livelihoods
Better quality of rural life entails enhancing agricultural productive capacities , promoting agro-processing for income creation and employment generation , reducing post harvest losses , and using local sources of renewable energy as potential livelihood growth impulses .
Can all these be triggered by South - South networks for grass - roots innovations , which have proved to be effective in rekindling rural sources of growth across a number of developing countries ?
The role of multilateral assistance
Can South - South cooperation in industrial development and trade be more meaningful and practical if new knowledge is generated by universities , exploited by laboratories and institutions , and commercialized by dynamic firms in an interactive manner , with a practical accent on poverty reduction ?
To this end , can multilateral assistance play a catalytic role in creating industrial innovation systems in the South ?
Developing countries stand to gain from exchanging experience and know - how , which encompass new sources of dynamic growth .
A. Commercializing existing research findings
Commercializing existing research findings is a formidable task for many developing countries .
For example , a number of research institutions across developing countries have discovered the medicinal uses of aromatic and medicinal plants , but are unable to commercialize those findings .
The commercialization of both product and process innovations could make a major breakthrough .
Can South - South cooperation facilitate the process ?
Free trade in consultancy and technology - related services
While it is relatively easy to acquire modern technologies by paying appropriate fees and costs , it is very difficult to maintain them without related service providers .
It is essential that consultancy and technology - related service providers be allowed to move freely , with limited restrictions , across developing countries .
How can technical manpower and technology - related service providers be attracted ? Should all barriers to skill mobility be eliminated ? What have been the lessons learned from the experience of the industrialized countries on these issues ?
C . The use of IT for exchange of experience and know - how
Viable approaches for the use of information and communication technology to produce a variety of downstream products with significant improvements in processing , design and marketing will need be to explored within the framework of South - South cooperation .
Can latecomers in the sphere of industrialization leapfrog and edge into a higher degree of industrialization through the use of IT ?
Efficient production systems and innovation encompass , among other things , new product development time , production lead time , flexibility in responding to changes in demand volume and variety , quality , price , responsiveness to customer delivery requirements , and use of state - of - the - art materials , processes and technologies .
In every case , the ability of firms to respond to these factors depends critically on the efficient production systems and innovation .
How can information and communication technologies enable firms in developing countries to learn best practice in production systems from each other within the framework of South - South cooperation ?
Growth is an important poverty - reducing force , and trade is the engine of growth .
Accelerating the pace of South - South cooperation - led industrialization and trade for poverty reduction hinges largely on determined efforts to address the above issues within the framework of a common agenda to use manufacturing , value chain and trade as dynamic forces of poverty reduction .
An agenda for action could deal with all generic issues related to enhancing productive capacities in trade , technology and investment flows and exchange of experience .
A joint response to poverty reduction should have a priority focus on :
( a ) Livelihood industry development ;
( b ) Use of renewable sources of energy as rural growth impulses ;
( c ) Transfer of technology for low - cost housing and basic infrastructure ;
( d ) Commercialization of research findings ; and
( e ) Linking value chain development with dynamic small and medium enterprises that serve as potential sources of income creation and employment generation .
South - South cooperation can not take place in isolation , and global connectivity is a prerequisite .
In making South - South cooperation complementary to North - South cooperation , how can multilateral assistance contribute effectively to bridge the missing links ?

Agenda item 124
Proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006 - 2007
Request for a subvention to the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research resulting from the recommendations of the Board of Trustees of the Institute on the work programme of the Institute for 2006 - 2007
Note by the Secretary - General
At its forty - fifth session , the Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters , in its capacity as the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research ( UNIDIR ) , approved , for submission to the General Assembly , the report of the Director of the Institute on its activities for the period from August 2004 to July 2005 and the proposed programme of work and estimated resource requirements for 2005 and 2006 ( see A/60/135 ) . The present report , reflecting the updated estimates that have since been provided by the Institute for review by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions , is submitted to the Assembly in the context of its consideration of a subvention to UNIDIR for 2006 - 2007 from the regular budget of the United Nations .
Through the aforementioned report of the Director of UNIDIR , the Board of Trustees recommended continuation of a subvention from the United Nations regular budget . Such a subvention is important for ensuring the independence of the Institute .
The proposed programme budget of the United Nations for the biennium 2006 - 2007 , under section 4 , Disarmament ( A / 60/6 ( Section 4 ) ) , contains a provision of $ 476,500 , representing the United Nations subvention to UNIDIR for the biennium .
Under section IV of resolution 44/201 B , entitled “ Subvention from the regular budget to the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research ” , the Secretary - General is required to report annually to the General Assembly on the situation of the Institute .
In this context , the updated financial situation of the Institute ( details of which are included in annexes I through IV to the present note ) may be summarized as follows :
( a ) Funds available at the beginning of 2005 amounted to $ 1,910,910 .
This figure includes an amount of $ 214,874 required as an operating cash reserve ;
( b ) Total income for 2005 is estimated at $ 4,040,000 , from the following sources : voluntary contributions and public donations ( $ 3,798,100 ) ; interest income ( $ 40,000 ) ; and the subvention from the United Nations regular budget ( $ 201,900 ) .
It is also estimated that of the total voluntary contributions and public donations , approximately 78.6 per cent will be used for special projects and 21.4 per cent for other purposes , including administrative costs ;
( c ) Total revised estimated expenditure for 2005 is $ 4,427,400 , including a provision of $ 201,200 for programme support costs .
Requirements for 2006 are estimated at $ 2,442,600 , inclusive of $ 105,500 for programme support costs ;
( d ) Available funds at the beginning of 2006 are estimated at $ 1,523,500 , inclusive of an amount of $ 603,600 as an operating cash reserve .
In part V , paragraph 3 , of its resolution 59/276 , the General Assembly requested the Secretary - General to make proposals in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006 - 2007 for biennial review and approval by the Assembly of subvention requirements of the Institute beginning with the biennium 2006 - 2007 .
In view of the perennial nature of the requirement for a subvention to UNIDIR , necessary provisions for this purpose have always been made in the proposed programme budget and subsequently appropriated for each biennium .
An annual request for a subvention is based on the annual provision included in the programme budget of the biennium .
In order to simplify the review and approval process by the Assembly , it is recommended that request for a subvention to UNIDIR be submitted on a biennial basis in the context of the consideration by the Assembly of the proposed programme budget for the related biennium .
This would also contribute to alleviating the heavy agenda of the legislative and expert reviewing bodies .
Should the General Assembly agree with the above proposal , a subvention of $ 476,500 ( before recosting ) from the regular budget of the United Nations is proposed for UNIDIR for the biennium 2006 - 2007 .
This amount will be subject to subsequent recosting in accordance with the established procedures .
No additional provision would be required , as related resources have been included under section 4 , Disarmament , of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006 - 2007 .
Accordingly , the General Assembly is requested to :
( a ) Endorse the proposal that request for a subvention to UNIDIR be submitted for review and approval by the General Assembly on a biennial basis in the context of its consideration of the proposed programme budget for the related biennium ;
( b ) Approve a subvention to UNIDIR of $ 476,500 ( before recosting ) from the regular budget of the United Nations for the biennium 2006 - 2007 .

Sixtieth session
Item 129 of the provisional agenda **
Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations
* Reissued for technical reasons .
Unpaid assessed contributions of the former Yugoslavia
Report of the Secretary - General
Introduction
During 1991 - 1992 , the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , which was admitted to membership in the United Nations in 1945 , underwent a process of dissolution and five successor States came into existence .
In its resolution 777 ( 1992 ) of 19 September 1992 , the Security Council indicated that it considered that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) could not continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations .
It therefore recommended to the General Assembly that it decide that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) should apply for membership in the United Nations and that it should not participate in the work of the Assembly .
In its resolution 47/1 of 22 September 1992 , the Assembly similarly indicated that it considered that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) could not continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations .
It therefore decided that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) should apply for membership in the United Nations and that it should not participate in the work of the Assembly .
In its resolution 821 ( 1993 ) of 28 April 1993 , the Security Council , inter alia , recommended to the Assembly that it decide that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) should not participate in the work of the Economic and Social Council .
In its resolution 47/229 of 29 April 1993 , the Assembly , inter alia , decided that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) should not participate in the work of the Economic and Social Council .
The Assembly did not , however , take any action to terminate the membership of the former Yugoslavia in the United Nations .
On the contrary , it included the former Yugoslavia in the scales of assessments that it adopted for the periods 1995 - 1997 and 1998 - 2000 , based on national income / gross national product data for Serbia and Montenegro .
As successor States to the former Yugoslavia were admitted to the United Nations during the scale period 1992 - 1994 , their initial rates of assessment were deducted from the rate of assessment initially assigned to the former Yugoslavia for 1992 - 1994 .
Their assessments in their respective years of admission were deducted from the assessments of the former Yugoslavia in those years .
From 27 April 1992 , when the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( renamed Serbia and Montenegro in February 2003 ) came into existence , until 27 October 2000 , when its President submitted to the Secretary - General an application for the admission of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to membership in the United Nations , the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia claimed that it constituted the Government of the Member State that was the former Yugoslavia .
This claim was advanced on the explicit basis that the State that was formerly known as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia continued to exist , that that State therefore continued to be a Member of the United Nations , that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia continued the personality under international law of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was therefore a State Member of the United Nations and that the Federal Republic was , in consequence , the same person of international law , and so the same Member State , as the former Yugoslavia .
In furtherance of its claim , the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia performed a large number of acts in the name of the former Yugoslavia in the period from 27 April 1992 to 27 October 2000 . These included having officials of the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia represent the former Yugoslavia in the Assembly and subsidiary organs , prior to the adoption of Assembly resolution 47/ 1 , and in the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies , prior to the adoption of Assembly resolution 47/229 .
In addition , on a number of occasions , the last being on 23 June 2000 , officials of the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia requested that they be invited to participate , as representatives of the former Yugoslavia , in meetings of the Security Council .
From 27 April 1992 to 1 November 2000 , the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia availed itself of the right of the former Yugoslavia , as a Member State , to establish and maintain missions to the United Nations at its Headquarters and Offices .
It also availed itself of the right of the former Yugoslavia , as a Member State , to circulate communications as official documents of the United Nations .
In its resolution 55/12 of 1 November 2000 , the Assembly decided to admit the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to membership in the United Nations .
That decision necessarily and automatically terminated the membership of the former Yugoslavia in the United Nations .
At that time , the former Yugoslavia had outstanding assessed contributions that had become due and payable both before and after the dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
The Secretary - General wrote to the President of the Assembly on 27 December 2001 to draw to the Assembly 's attention the question of the unpaid assessed contributions of the former Yugoslavia .1 In the annex to his letter , the Secretary - General provided information concerning this question and highlighted issues about which the Assembly would need to decide .
In its resolution 56/243 B of 27 March 2002 , the Assembly requested the Committee on Contributions to consider the issues raised and to report thereon to the Assembly at its fifty - seventh session .
This the Committee did in its report on its sixty - second session .2 In its resolution 57/ 4 B of 20 December 2002 , the Assembly decided to consider the question further at its fifty - eighth session .
Updated information on the outstanding assessed contributions of the former Yugoslavia was provided in a note by the Secretary - General .3 In its resolution 58/ 1 B of 23 December 2003 , the Assembly decided to defer consideration of the question until its fifty - ninth session .
In its resolution 59/1 B of 23 December 2004 , the Assembly decided to defer consideration of the question until the first part of its resumed fifty - ninth session .
In its decision 59/551 B of 13 April 2005 , the Assembly decided to defer the matter for future consideration .
The position of the five successor States to the former Yugoslavia was set out in letters from their Permanent Representatives to the Under - Secretary - General for Management dated 17 September and 19 November 2001 and August 2005 , and to the Chairman of the Committee on Contributions dated 29 May 2002 .
These letters are contained in annexes I , II , III and IV .
In the period since the Secretary - General sent his letter in 2001 , the Agreement on Succession Issues between the five successor States of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia entered into force on 2 June 2004 .
The present report deals with the outstanding assessed contributions of the former Yugoslavia and not with any amounts owed by Serbia and Montenegro in respect of expenditures incurred by the United Nations Peace Forces for items that should have been provided without cost under the status of forces agreement .
In paragraph 10 of its resolution 51/12 of 4 November 1996 , the Assembly urged the Secretary - General to convey its concerns to the Governments concerned as well as its request that the Governments reimburse the combined Forces for those expenditures .
The Assembly also requested the Secretary - General to withhold settlement of claims submitted by the Governments concerned until the matter of the expenditures was resolved .
